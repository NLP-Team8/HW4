hospital with the above chief complaint.  the patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  she states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  she has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  the patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,procedure:  ,an iv was instituted by the department of anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  the patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  copious amounts of webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  after adequate sedation by the department of anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an esmarch bandage.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmhg.  the foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  the sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  the area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  a curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  at that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  the incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  all vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  the dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  a linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  the periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  a bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  an osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  after resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  the surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  the area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  the area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  the area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 vicryl.  the subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  there was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  the incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  the incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  at that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  a sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,all remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  the area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  the area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 vicryl.  subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  steri-strips were applied to both surgical sites.  dressings consisted of adaptic, soaked in betadine, 4x4s, kling, kerlix, and coban.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,the patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  the patient was transferred to the pacu with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  the patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.  the patient is to follow-up with dr. x in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise.","orthopedic, navicula, metatarsal, osteochondroma, tarsectomy,

minimal.,gross intraoperative findings:,1.  a compressed median nerve at the carpal tunnel, which was flattened.,2.  a stenosing tenosynovitis of the a1 pulley of the right index as well as middle fingers.  after the a1 pulley was released, there was evidence of some synovitis as well as some fraying of the flexor digitorum profundus as well as flexor digitorum superficialis tendons.,history:  ,this is a 78-year-old male who is complaining of right hand pain and numbness with decreased range of the middle index finger and right middle finger complaining of catching and locking.  the patient was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome on bilateral hands the right being worse than the left.  he had positive emg findings as well as clinical findings.  the patient did undergo an injection, which only provided him with temporary relief and is for this reason, he has consented to undergo the above-named procedure.,all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,procedure:  ,the patient was wheeled back to the operating room #1 at abcd general hospital on 08/29/03.  he was placed supine on the operating room table.  next, a non-sterile tourniquet was placed on the right forearm, but not inflated.  at this time, 8 cc of 0.25% marcaine with epinephrine was instilled into the carpal tunnel region of the volar aspect of the wrist for anesthesia.  in addition, an additional 2 cc were used on the superficial skin of the volar palm over the a1 pulley of the right index and right middle fingers.  at this time, the extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  first, we went for release of the carpal tunnel.  approximately 2.5 cm incision was made over the volar aspect of the wrist over the carpal tunnel region.  first, dissection through the skin in the superficial fascia was performed with a self-retractor placed in addition to ragnells retracting proximally and distally.  the palmaris brevis muscle was then identified and sharply transected.  at this time, we identified the transverse carpal tunnel ligament and a #15 blade was used to sharply and carefully release that fascia.  once the fascia of the transverse carpal ligament was transected, the identification of the median nerve was visualized.  the resection of the ligament was taken both proximally and distally to assure complete release and it was checked thoroughly.  at this time, a neurolysis was performed and no evidence of space-occupying lesions were identified within the carpal tunnel.  at this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  the wound was suctioned dry.  at this time, we proceeded to the release of the a1 pulleys.  approximately, a 1.5 cm incision was made over the a1 pulley in the volar aspect of the palm of the right index and right middle fingers.  first, we went for the index finger.  once the skin incision was made, metzenbaum scissor was used to longitudinally dissect the subcutaneous tissue and with ragnell retractors we identified the a1 pulley.  a #15 blade was used to make a longitudinal slit along with a1 pulley and the littler scissors were used to release the a1 pulley proximally as well as distally.  once this was performed, a tendon hook was then used to wrap the tendon and release the tendons both proximally and distally and they were removed from the wound in order to check their integrity.  there was some evidence of synovitis in addition to some fraying of the both the profundus as well as superficialis tendons.  once a thorough release was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate that wound.  in the similar fashion, a 1.5 cm incision was made over the volar aspect of the a1 pulley of the right middle finger.  a littler scissor was used to bluntly dissect in the longitudinal fashion.  with the ragnell retractors, we identified the a1 pulley of the right middle finger.,using a #15 blade, the a1 pulley was scored with the #15 blade and the litter scissor was used to complete the release of the a1 pulley distally and proximally.  we again placed the tendon hook around both the superficialis and the profundus tendons and they were extruded from the wound to check their integrity.  again, there was evidence of some synovitis as well as fraying of both tendons.  the girth of both tendons and both wounds were within normal limits.  at this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  the patient was then asked to intraoperatively flex and extend his fingers and he was able to fully flex his fingers to make a close fit which he was not able to do preoperatively.  in addition, he was able to abduct his thumb indicating that the recurrent branch of the median nerve was intact.  at this time, #5-0 nylon was used to approximate in a vertical mattress type fashion both the carpal tunnel incision as well as the both a1 pulley incisions of the right middle finger and right index finger.  the wound closure took place after the tourniquet was released and hemostasis was obtained with bovie cautery.  at this time, a short-arm splint was placed on the volar aspect of the wrist after it was wrapped in a sterile dressing consisting of adaptic and kerlix roll.  the patient was then carefully taken off of the operating room table to recovery in stable condition.","orthopedic, compressed median

all of which have provided inadequate relief.  at this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  the risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by dr. x and the consent is available on the chart for review.,procedure in detail: , after iv was established by the department of anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  copious amounts of webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the webril.,after adequate iv sedation was administered by the department of anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard mayo block fashion.  the foot was elevated off the table.  esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmhg.  the foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  a sterile betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  a #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  all superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  the capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  a hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  the medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  next, a 0.45 inch kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  a sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,the capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  the bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  next, a 0.45 inch kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  a 2.7 x 18 mm synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard ao technique.  excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  a second 2.0 x 80 mm synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard ao technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  the temporary fixation was removed.  a medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  the foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,a sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  a distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal akin osteotomy was done.,after the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  a #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  a #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  the monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  the foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  next, a #3-0 vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  next, #4-0 vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  the steri-strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of owen silk, 4 x 4s, kling, kerlix, and coban.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  the patient tolerated the above anesthesia and

8 pm on 12/26 and entered the house where the decedent's body was located at approximately 8:20 pm. ,a brief examination of the body disclosed a ligature around the neck and a ligature around the right wrist. also noted was a small area of abrasion or contusion below the right ear on the lateral aspect of the right cheek. a prominent dried abrasion was present on the lower left neck. after examining the body, i left the residence at approximately 8:30 pm. ,external evidence of injury:, located just below the right ear at the right angle of the mandible, 1.5 inches below the right external auditory canal is a 3/8 x 1/4 inch area of rust colored abrasion. in the lateral aspect of the left lower eyelid on the inner conjunctival surface is a 1 mm in maximum dimension petechial hemorrhage. very fine, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin of the upper eyelids bilaterally as well as on the lateral left cheek. on everything the left upper eyelid there are much smaller, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages located on the conjunctival surface. possible petechial hemorrhages are also seen on the conjunctival surfaces of the right upper and lower eyelids, but liver mortis on this side of the face makes definite identification difficult. ,a deep ligature furrow encircles the entire neck. the width of the furrow varies from one- eight of an inch to five/sixteenths of an inch and is horizontal in orientation, with little upward deviation. the skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature furrow contains areas of petechial hemorrhage and abrasion encompassing an area measuring approximately 3 x 2 inches. the ligature furrow crosses the anterior midline of the neck just below the laryngeal prominence, approximately at the level of the cricoid cartilage. it is almost completely horizontal with slight upward deviation from the horizontal towards the back of the neck. the midline of the furrow mark on the anterior neck is 8 inches below the top of the head. the midline of the furrow mark on the posterior neck is 6.75 inches below the top of the head. ,the area of abrasion and petechial hemorrhage of the skin of the anterior neck includes on the lower left neck, just to the left of the midline, a roughly triangular, parchment-like rust colored abrasion which measures 1.5 inches in length with a maximum width of 0.75 inches. this roughly triangular shaped abrasion is obliquely oriented with the apex superior and lateral. the remainder of the abrasions and petechial hemorrhages of the skin above and below the anterior projection of the ligature furrow are nonpatterned, purple to rust colored, and present in the midline, right, and left areas of the anterior neck. the skin just above the ligature furrow along the right side of the neck contains petechial hemorrhage composed of multiple confluent very small petechial hemorrhages as well as several larger petechial hemorrhages measuring up to one-sixteenth and one-eight of an inch in maximum dimension. similar smaller petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin below the ligature furrow on the left lateral aspect of the neck. located on the right side of the chin is a three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch area of superficial abrasion. on the posterior aspect of the right shoulder is a poorly demarcated, very superficial focus of abrasion/contusion which is pale purple in color and measures up to three-quarters by one-half inch in maximum dimension. several linear aggregates of petechial hemorrhages are present in the anterior left shoulder just above deltopectoral groove. these measure up to one inch in length by one-sixteenth to one-eight of an inch in width. on the left lateral aspect of the lower back, approximately sixteen and one-quarter inches and seventeen and one-half inches below the level of the top of the head are two dried rust colored to slightly purple abrasions. the more superior of the two measures one-eight by one-sixteenth of an inch and the more inferior measures three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch. there is no surrounding contusion identified. on the posterior aspect of the left lower leg, almost in the midline, approximately 4 inches above the level of the heel are two small scratch-like abrasions which are dried and rust colored. they measure one-sixteenth by less than one- sixteenth of an inch and one-eight by less than one-sixteenth of an inch respectively. ,on the anterior aspect of the perineum, along the edges of closure of the labia majora, is a small amount of dried blood. a similar small amount of dried and semifluid blood is present on the skin of the fourchette and in the vestibule. inside the vestibule of the vagina and along the distal vaginal wall is reddish hyperemia. this hyperemia is circumferential and perhaps more noticeable on the right side and posteriorly. the hyperemia also appears to extend just inside the vaginal orifice. a 1 cm red-purple area of abrasion is located on the right posterolateral area of the 1 x 1 cm hymeneal orifice. the hymen itself is represented by a rim of mucosal tissue extending clockwise between the 2 and 10:00 positions. the area of abrasion is present at approximately the 7:00 position and appears to involve the hymen and distal right lateral vaginal wall and possibly the area anterior to the hymen. on the right labia majora is a very faint area of violent discoloration measuring approximately one inch by three-eighths of an inch. incision into the underlying subcutaneous tissue discloses no hemorrhage. a minimal amount of semiliquid thin watery red fluid is present in the vaginal vault. no recent or remote anal or other perineal trauma is identified. ,remainder of external

since mid night for surgery on her painful right foot bunion, hammer toes, and tailor's bunion.  the patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis.  she has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step.  she has tried multiple conservative measures under dr. x's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief.  at this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction.  the consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by dr. x.,procedure in detail: , after iv was established by the department of anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  next, copious amounts of webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the webril.  next, after adequate iv sedation was administered by the department of anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique.  next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  an esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmhg.  the foot was lowered in the operative field.  the sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint.  the joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe.  in addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray.  there was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal.  using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length.  next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery.  next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection.  the joint capsule was then visualized.  two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule.  a dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade.  the capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal  phalanx.,a large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint.  in addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal.  upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head.  a sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare.  next, the bone was passed out as specimen.  the head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation.  the tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue.  this was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed.  the fibular sesamoid was in the interspace.  a lateral release was performed in addition.  next, the mcglamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed.  the metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure.  next, the biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint.  a small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx.  the trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed.,next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  a median large porous biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position.  it had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level.  next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline.  the flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly.  a #3-0 vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion.  a medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous.  next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  next, the skin was closed with #5-0 monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.,attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature.  there was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted.  a linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length.  the incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue.  next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.,next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint.  the tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally.  the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  the bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded.  the base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage.  a sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected.  a 0.045 inch kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft.  the toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position.  an extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed.  the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  a #3-0 vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis.  a #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  the wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion.,attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated.  the same suture material was used and the same 0.045 kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation.,attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated.  the same suture material was used.  however, a 0.062 kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight.  next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well.  a linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length.  a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected.  the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  a sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  the toe assumed to more rectus position.  the reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces.  the joint was again flushed with saline.  next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique.,next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin.  a #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head.  the incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue.  any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively.  next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade.  the capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly.  a sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone.  a reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  the capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  a bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures.  the skin was closed with #5-0 monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  the ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 monocryl.  attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated.  therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  the tendon was transected.  next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed.  next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position.  one #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin.,mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds.  betadine-soaked owen silk was applied to all wounds.  betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  all the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped.  a standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, kling, kerlix, and coban were applied.  the patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  she was transported via cart to the postanesthesia care unit with vital signs stable and vascular status

for a refill of imuran.  he is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  he is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  in fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. an x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  he thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  he has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  the patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  he has not had any rectal bleeding. he asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with iv insertion.  he has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  the tenderness has now completely resolved.  , ,he had a colonoscopy performed in august of 2003, by dr. s.  an anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  dr. s recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  no active crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  , ,earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  at that time he was taking a lot of tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  under dr. s's recommendation, he stopped the imuran for one month and reduced his dose of tylenol.  since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the

for deep brain stimulation.  the procedure is discussed below.,i have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives.  she fully accepted and consented to the procedure.,procedure in detail:,  the patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition.  she was placed on the operating table in seated position.  her head was shaved.  scalp was prepped with betadine and a leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes.  iv antibiotics were administered as was the sedation.  she was then transported to the ct scan and stereotactic volumetric ct scan of the head was undertaken.  the images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-d reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen.  target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the ac-pc midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the ac-pc midpoint, and 4 mm below the ac-pc midpoint.  each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as leksell coordinates.,the patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again.  foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the mayfield unit.  at this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes.  sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field.  this same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture.,a bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings.  bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture.  hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field.  using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and stryker drill.  the bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade.  the cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well.  the leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame.  microelectrode drive was secured to the arc.  microelectrode recording was then performed.  the signatures of the cells were recognized.  microelectrode unit was removed.  deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted.  the dbs electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed.  using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side.  this electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system.,attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system.  the microelectrode unit was then remounted.  microelectrode recording was then undertaken.  after multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed.  deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory.  the dbs electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box.  using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side.  this electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system.  the arc was then removed.  a subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel.,we then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally.  copious amounts of betadine irrigation were used.  hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only.  closure was instituted using 3-0 vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples.  sterile dressings were applied.  the leksell arc was then removed.,she was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.  all needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as

the patient was brought into the operating room.  a surgical time-out was performed during which all members of the operating room staff agreed upon the patient's name, operation to be performed, and correct operative eye.  after administration of general anesthesia, the patient was intubated without incident.,the right eye was prepared and draped in the usual fashion for ophthalmic surgery.  a wire lid speculum was used to separate the eyelids of the left eye.  a 9 o'clock anterior chamber paracentesis was created with supersharp blade and the anterior chamber was filled with healon.  the clear corneal incision was superior to the visual axis and was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures with the knots buried.  a standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy __________ was initiated by performing partial conjunctival peritomies in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants with westcott scissors.  hemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery.  a 7-0 vicryl suture was preplaced in the mattress fashion, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.  a microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy at this site and a 4-mm infusion cannula was introduced through the sclerotomy and tied in place with the aforementioned suture.  the presence of the tip of the cannula was confirmed to be within the vitreous cavity prior to initiation of posterior infusion.  two additional sclerotomies were created superonasally and superotemporally, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus with microvitreoretinal blade.,the vitreous cutter was used to perform the pars plana lens actively preserving peripheral anterior capsule.  the pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the assistance of the biom non-contact lens indirect viewing system using the light pipe illuminator and the vitreous cutter.  the vitreous was trimmed to the vitreous base.  a posterior vitreous detachment was created and extended 360 degrees with the assistance of triamcinolone for staining.,the foreign body appeared to exit the posterior pole along the superotemporal arcade and apparently severed a branched retinal artery resulting in an area of macular ischemia with retinal whitening along its course.  the exit wound was explored.  no intraocular foreign body or mural foreign body was observed with the assistance of intraocular forceps.  the intraocular magnet was then inserted through the sclerotomy and no foreign body was again identified.,an air-fluid exchange was performed with the assistance of the soft-tip extrusion cannula and the retinal periphery was examined with scleral depression.  no retinal breaks or defects were noted in the periphery.  the plugs were placed in the sclerotomies and the conjunctival peritomy was extended at 360 degrees.  each of the rectus muscles was isolated on a 2-0 silk suture and a #xxx band was threaded beneath each of the rectus muscle and fixed to itself in the inferonasal quadrant with the watzke sleeve.  the buckle was sutured to the eye wall with 5-0 mersilene sutures in each quadrant in a mattress fashion.  the buckle was trimmed and the height of the buckle was inspected internally and noted to be adequate.,residual intraocular fluid was removed with a soft-tip extrusion cannula and the sclerotomies were closed with 7-0 vicryl sutures.  a 12% concentration of c3f8 gas was flushed through the eye.  the infusion cannula was removed and the sclerotomy was closed with the preplaced 7-0 vicryl suture.  all of the sclerotomies were noted to be airtight.  the intraocular pressure following injection of 0.05 ml each of vancomycin (0.5 mg) and ceftazidime (1 mg) were injected through the superotemporal pars plana, 30-gauge needles.,the conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut sutures with the knots buried.  subconjunctival injections of ancef and decadron were delivered inferotemporally.  the lid speculum was removed.  pred-g ointment and atropine solution were applied to the ocular surface.  the eye was patched and shielded, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  there were no complications.,i was the attending surgeon, was present and scrubbed for the entirety of the procedure.",

right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  a sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle.  the patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava.  a percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava.  after satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium.  after the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place.  a cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium.  the wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the swan-ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field.  cardiectomy was then performed, first resecting the anterior portion of the right atrium and then transecting the aorta, the pulmonary artery, the septum between the right and left atriums, and then the heart was removed.  the right and left atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were prepared for the transplant.  first, we did a side-to-side anastomosis, continued to the left atrium and this was performed using 3-0 prolene suture and a right atrial anastomosis side-to-side was performed using 3-0 prolene suture.  the pulmonary artery was then anastomosed using 5-0 prolene and the aorta was anastomosed with 4-0 prolene.  the arterial anastomosis in the pulmonary artery and aorta were not completed until the heart was filled with blood.  air was evacuated and the sutures were tied down.  the clamp on the ascending aorta was removed and the patient was gradually overtime weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  the patient had a postoperative coagulopathy which prolonged the period of time in the operating room after completion and weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass.  blood factors and factor vii were given to try and correct the coagulopathy.  because of excessive transfusions that were required, a mahurkar catheter was inserted through the left common femoral vein, first placing a needle into the vein and then guidewire removed, and the needle dilators were then placed and then the mahurkar catheter was then placed with 2-0 nylon suture.  hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time.  after he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound.  the patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively.  this was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy.  the patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor vii.  urine output for the procedure was 520 ml.  the preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet.  the estimated blood loss was at least 6 l.  the

maintaining hemostasis.  number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  the right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  an esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmhg.  attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  the incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  all major neurovascular structures were avoided.  at this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  this was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  this was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  at this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  the periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  a 0.045 inch k-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  the patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  the dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  at this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  at this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch k-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  two of the three of these k-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard ao technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm osteomed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  compression was noted to be excellent.  all guide wires and 0.045-inch k-wires were then removed.  utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  the wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  at this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  at this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  at this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,a periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  utilizing the sagittal saw, a weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  the head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  a 0.045-inch k-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm osteomed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  this was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  the wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  the periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  at this time, 10 ml of 0.5% marcaine plain and 1 ml of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  the right foot was then dressed with xeroform gauze, fluffs, kling, and ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  the patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  after a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with dr. a.  the patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  the patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  the patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  dr. a was present throughout the entire case.","orthopedic, tailor bunionectomy, weil-type, screw fixation, hallux, abductovalgus, bunion, tailor,

,severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.  the patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  this was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,history:  ,this is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  she underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by dr. x in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  all risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  the patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,procedure: , the patient was wheeled back to the operating room #2 at abcd general hospital on 08/27/03.  the general anesthetic was first performed by the department of anesthesia.  the patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  an axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a foley catheter, which was inserted by the or nurse.  all her bony prominences were well padded.  at this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  at this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  the tensor fascia lata was then identified.  a self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  at this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  at this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  the tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  at this time, after hemostasis was obtained, bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  at this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  a ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  once this was performed, homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  at this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  at this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  at this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  at this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  we made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  at this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,the femoral head was then removed.  at this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  a long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  with better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  we started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  at the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  we then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  a size 54 mm trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  at this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  at this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  the leg was then placed back in the bag.  a bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  a rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  a box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  a charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  a power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  at this time, we began broaching.  we started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  a calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  a standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  at this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  this was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  we copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  at this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  the 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  we were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  next, a #1 ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  a tight closure was performed.  since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  staples were then used for skin closure.  the patient's hip was then cleansed.  sterile dressings consisting of adaptic, 4 x 4, abds, and foam tape were then placed.  a drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  after the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  prognosis is good.","surgery, degenerative arthritis,

postoperative changes and a significant septal spur along the floor.  there is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.,indications:  ,the patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  he now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a cpap machine.  therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,description of the procedure in detail:  ,the patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the or table.  after the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  the caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  there was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  this was very carefully harvested.  this area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  following this, the cartilage was removed.  it was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  the spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  after an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  these were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 pds suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  this was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  the lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  this may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  an endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 pds suture.  following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  the curvilinear incision was closed using a vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 prolene sutures.  the marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  they had ointment also placed on them.  following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  there were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of steri-strips.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  he was awakened in the operating room.  he was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, nasal septal deviation, nasal septal, auricular cartilage, nasal, nasal obstruction, nasal valve, septoplasty, submucoperichondrial, upper airway, internal nasal valve, external

anesthesia.,complications:  ,none.,counts: , correct.,specimens sent:  ,none.,clinical history:  ,the patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling.  he was worked by the neurologist, dr. x, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  i was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram ct scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  the patient had worst disease at level c3-c4, c4-c5, and c5-c6.  the patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  i thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  conservative management was not an option.  the patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  i discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  the risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  an informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  he was brought into the or today for the operative procedure.,description of procedure:  ,the patient was brought into the or, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  intubation was done under c-spine precautions.  the patient received preoperative vancomycin and decadron.  he was hooked up to the ssep apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,with a large a shoulder roll, i extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  all the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,using a knife and cautery, i took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  prominent osteophyte at c5-c6 was noted, lesser at c4-c5.  intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from c3-c6.,trimline retractors were put in, and i cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,with the drill, i performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as i went.  i then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  worst findings at c3-c4 followed c5-c6 and then c4-c5.  excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  with change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,the patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  this was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  i thus elected to give him ddavp, platelets, and used horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  this took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,i then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  these were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  excellent graft alignment was achieved.,i now brought in a depuy titanium eagle plate, and i fixed it to the spine from c3 to c6.  fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  the patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  i inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a jackson-pratt drain 10-french was put in with trocar.  decision was made to start the closure.  so, i closed the platysma with 3-0 vicryl and used staples for the skin.  a simple primapore or medpore dressing was applied.  the patient was extubated in the or and taken to the psu in stable medical condition.,when i saw the patient in the icu, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  he had done well from the surgery.  blood loss was 350 cc.  all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  no complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  no specimens were sent.,the patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  the patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  i will keep him on decadron and keep the collar on.  i do not think there is need for halo rest.  we will be obtaining formal c-spine films in the morning.  prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.",

digit.,postoperative diagnosis: , hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,procedure performed: , arthroplasty of the right second digit.,the patient is a 77-year-old hispanic male who presents to abcd hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe.  the patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  the patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  h&p is complete.,procedure in detail:,  after an iv was instituted by the department of anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  using webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  after adequate anesthesia was administered by the department of anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  the foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  the foot was then elevated and esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmhg.  the foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the esmarch bandage was removed.  a wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  this was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  the medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an adson-brown pickup.  it was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  the tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  the tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  the proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  the head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the adson-brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  the wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  the digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  then using a #3-0 vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  the toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  the toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, kling, and coban.  the tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits i through v of the right foot.,the patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the postanesthesia care unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  while in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  the patient was given pain medications of tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  the patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  the patient will followup with dr. x on tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  the patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications.","surgery, hammertoe deformity, arthroplasty, digit, proximal interphalangeal joint, periosteal tissue, interrupted sutures, interphalangeal joint, proximal phalanx, proximal,

 pain management for post-laminectomy low back syndrome and radiculopathy.  , Chiropractic, Pain Management Consult - 1 ,"mr. xyz forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  for all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and i had to curtail the amount of time i spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  the patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  to summarize the history here, mr. xyz who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  at that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  the patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  he experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of l4-l5 and l5-s1.  the patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  he was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in may of 2005.  at that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  mr. xyz felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  he was mri'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an l5-s1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in houston, where he underwent fusion by dr. w from l3 through s2.  this was done on 12/15/2005.  initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  he is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  the patient was referred to dr. a, pain management specialist and dr. a has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  the patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  he has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  the patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by tir rehab center.  at that time, it was felt that mr. xyz showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  there were no indications in the evaluation that mr. xyz showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  it was felt at that time that mr. xyz would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  mr. xyz indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  he still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  the impression was that the patient had axis iv diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis iii diagnosis.  this was done by rhonda ackerman, ph.d., a psychologist.  it was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  despite these evaluations, mr. xyz really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of ssris.  of concern in june of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  his hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  it was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  in september of 2006, the patient was evaluated at baylor college of medicine in the occupational health program.  the evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  evaluation was done by dr. b.  at present, mr. xyz continues on with his oxycodone and norco.  these were prescribed by dr. a two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  the patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  he is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  he spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching tv and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  the patient denies smoking at this time.  he denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  he obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  review of mri done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at l3 through s1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left l4-5 and s1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  there is a small right posterior herniation at l1-l2.,past medical history:,

 cardiac catheterization.   coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis., Surgery, Cardiac Catheterization - 12 ,"preoperative diagnosis: , coronary artery disease.,postoperative diagnosis: , coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.,description of procedure:,left heart catheterization with angiography and mid abdominal aortography:,under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  using the percutaneous seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  coronary arteriography was performed with 6-french performed coronary catheters.  we used a 6-french jr4 and jl4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  after using the jr4 6-french catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  a pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,analysis of pressure data: , left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmhg.  on continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  the aortic pressures were normal.  contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,analysis of angiograms:,  selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  a pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  the mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  the left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  the ascending aorta appeared normal.,pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  an abdominal aortic injection was performed.  under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  there was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  the abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  there is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  the celiac seems to be normal, but what i believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  the common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,coronary anatomy:,  one notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  cineangiogram obtained with 6-french jr4 and 5-french jr4 catheters.  prior to the introduction of the 5-french jr4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  the 6-french jr4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  there was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  we then removed the 6-french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-french catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  at the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn area.,the left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  it forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,the left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  it gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what i believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  i could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,the ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,the left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,the patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  there is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.,the patient tolerated the procedure well.  the catheter was removed.  hemostasis was achieved.  the patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.,impression:,1.  excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.,2.  calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  the left and right renal arteries are normal.  the external iliac arteries are normal.,3.  essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.,4.  ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  the proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,recommendations:  ,the patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  the ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  it is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an ivus and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  we will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  continue aggressive medical therapy.","surgery, intimal calcification, stenosis, coronary artery disease, mid abdominal aorta, coronary artery, cardiac catheterization,

", Consult - History and Phy., Status Epilepticus ,"chief complaint:,  status epilepticus.,history of present illness:  ,the patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis.  at baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  his speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  he ambulates independently, but falls often.  he has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  he is being followed by medical therapy unit and has also been seen in the past by dr. x.  he has not received botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,the patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,the patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  these occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  his events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  he has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  he tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  he has been followed by dr. y and was started on trileptal.  at one point, the patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  he was more recently placed on topamax since march 2007.  his last seizures were in march and may respectively.  he is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,the patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  his seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  family administered diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  they did not know they could repeat this dose.  ems was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  his seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  he is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,review of systems: , at this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  he does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  he denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  there is no numbness or loss of skills.  he has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  he has no oropharyngeal complaints.  visual or auditory complaints.,past medical history: , also positive for some mild scoliosis.,social history: , the patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.  there are no ill contacts.,family history: , noncontributory.,physical examination:,general:  the patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.,vital signs:  his vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.,heent:  atraumatic and normocephalic.  oropharynx shows no lesions.,neck:  supple without adenopathy.,chest:  clear to auscultation.,cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.,abdomen:  benign without organomegaly.,extremities:  no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,neurologic:  the patient is alert and will follow instructions.  his speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  he is about 50% understandable at best.  he does put words and sentences together.  his cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  his extraocular movements are intact.  his visual fields are full.  disks are sharp bilaterally.  his face shows left facial weakness postictally.  his palate elevates midline.  vision is intact bilaterally.  tongue protrudes midline.,motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  his left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  he has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  right upper extremity is much more on target.  his sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  when sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  he also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  gait was not tested today.,impression: , this is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  he is on topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  at this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  the plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  i also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  the plan from ct standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  he may benefit from botox.,in addition, i reviewed the diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  they are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call ems at any point during that time.  hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures

is a 52-year-old male who is here for independent medical evaluation.  the patient states that he works for abc abc as a temporary worker.  he worked for abcd too.  the patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  the patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  date of injury occurred back in october.  the patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in october, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at abc and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  this became progressively worse.  he also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  he noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  he initially saw dr. z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or lidoderm patch, i believe.  the patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  at this point, the patient later on was referred to dr. xyz through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in april.  after the evaluation, the patient was sent for mri, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  he was put on restricted duty.  the mri essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by dr. xyz in june with maximum medical improvement.,unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see dr. xyz again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for pain clinic referral.  the patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by dr. abc without any significant relief.  the patient also was sent for emg and nerve conduction study, which was performed by dr. abcd and the mri, emg, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by dr. abcd.  the patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping.  he has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in june, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in june.  the patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  the patient also went to see dr. x who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.,physical examination:,  the patient was examined with the gown on.  lumbar flexion was moderately decreased.  extension was normal.  side bending to the right was decreased.  side bending to the left was within normal limits.  rotation and extension to the right side was causing increasing pain.  extension and side bending to the left was within normal limits without significant pain on the left side.  while seated, straight leg was negative on the lle at 90° and also negative on the rle at 90°.  there was no true root tension sign or radicular symptoms upon straight leg raising in the seated position.  in supine position, straight leg was negative in the lle and also negative on the rle.  sensory exam shows there was a decrease in sensation to the s1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch and at all other dermatomal distribution was within normal limits.  deep tendon reflex at the patella was 2+/4 bilaterally, but there was a decrease in reflex in the achilles tendon 1+/4 on the right side and essentially 2+/4 on the left side.  medial hamstring reflex was 2+/4 on both hamstrings as well.  on prone position, there was tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle as well as tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area, right side was worse than the left side.  increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the l5 and s1 level.,medical record review:,  i had the opportunity to review dr. xyz's medical records.  also reviewed dr. abc procedural note, which was the epidural steroid injection block that was performed in december.  also, reviewed dr. x's medical record notes and an emg and nerve study that was performed by dr. abcd, which was essentially normal.  the mri of the lumbar spine that was performed back in april, which showed no evidence of herniated disc.,diagnosis: , residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatology.,evaluation/recommendation:,  the patient has an impairment based on ama guides fifth edition and it is permanent.  the patient appears to have re-aggravation of the low back injury back in october related to his work at abc when he was working unloading and loading an 18-wheel truck.  essentially, there was a clear aggravation of his symptoms with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left.  the patient also has increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side.  with these ongoing symptoms, the patient has also decrease in activities of daily living such as mobility as well as decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function.  therefore, the patient is assigned 8% impairment of the whole person.  we are able to assign this utilizing the fifth edition on spine section on the ama guide.  using page 384, table 15-3, the patient does fall under dre lumbar category ii under criteria for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury.  in this particular section, it states that the patient's clinical history and examination findings are compatible with specific injury; and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination, a symmetric loss of range of motion, or non-verifiable radicular complaints define his complaints of radicular pain without objective findings; no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy.  the patient also has decrease in activities of daily living; therefore, the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8% wpi.  in the future, the patient should avoid prolonged walking, standing, stooping, squatting, hip bending, climbing, excessive flexion, extension, and rotation of his back.  his one time weight limit should be determined by work trial, although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain.  the patient although has a clear low back pain with certain movements such as stooping and extended sitting and does have a clear radicular symptomatology, the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to short-acting opioids in the near future by specialist who could monitor and closely follow his overall pain management.  the patient also should be treated with appropriate modalities and appropriate rehabilitation in the near future.,","orthopedic, rle, radicular symptoms, independent medical evaluation, injury, lle, deep tendon reflex, emg, mri, lumbar radicular symptomatology,"

 laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy due to right renal mass., Surgery, Nephrectomy - Partial (Laparoscopic ) ,"preoperative diagnosis: , right renal mass.,postoperative diagnosis: , right renal mass.,procedure performed: , laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy.,estimated blood loss:,  250 ml.,x-rays: , none.,specimens: , included right renal mass as well as biopsies from the base of the resection.,anesthesia:,  general endotracheal.,complications: , none.,drains: , included a jp drain in the right flank as well as a #16-french foley catheter per urethra.,brief history: , the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of an enhancing right renal mass approximately 2 cm in diameter.  i had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options.  we talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery.  based on his young age and excellent state of health, decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically.  all questions were answered, and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned.  note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma.,procedure in detail: , after acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  after institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod, he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest.  all pressure points were carefully padded, and he was securely taped to the table.  note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia.  his abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  note that a #16-french foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube.  the abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident.  we then placed a visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen.  with the trocar in place, we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization.  we placed three additional trocars.  an 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus, a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus, and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline.,the procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of toldt.  the colon was reflected medially, and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side.  this was a fairly superficial lesion, so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping, however, i did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial.  with the colon reflected, the duodenum was identified, and it was reflected medially under kocher maneuver.  the ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated.  the space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed, and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter, and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum.  once we got up to the renal hilum, we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially, and in particular, we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a satinsky clamp or bulldogs.  the remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the harmonic scalpel and the ligasure device.,with the kidney free and the hilum prepared, the gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma, and using this approach, we were able to identify the 2-cm, right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally.  a cap of fat was left overlying this mass.  based on the position of the mass, we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound, which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated.  based on this finding, i decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection.  a satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc.  note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure, and he also received lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum.  with the renal hilum clamped, we did resect the tumor using cold scissors.  there was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping; however, we were able to successfully resect this lesion.  we also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section.  with the tumor resected, the base of the resection was then cauterized using the argon beam coagulator, and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure-of-eight 3-0 vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning.  we then placed a floseal into the wound and covered it with a surgicel and held the pressure.  we then released the vascular clamp.  total clamp time was 11 minutes.  there was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver, and after unclamping the kidney, the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp.  we then replaced the kidney within its gerota envelope and closed that with 3-0 vicryl using lap ties for tensioning.  a jp drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2-0 nylon.  the specimen was placed into a 10-mm endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm.  it was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for pathology to evaluate.  they stated that the tumor was close to the margin, but there appeared to be 1-2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor.  in addition, the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma.  based on these findings, the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 vicryl suture in the fascia.  we then re-insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis.  any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips.  the area was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  the colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position.  the mesentry was evaluated.  there were no defects noted.  we closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a carter-thompson closure device with 0-vicryl.  all trocars were removed under direct visualization, and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar.  the skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0.25% marcaine, and the skin was closed using a running 4-0 monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  benzoin and steri-strips were placed.  the patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident.  he was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring.  at the end of the case, sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct.  i was scrubbed and present throughout the entire case.","surgery, renal mass, foley catheter, gerota fascia, jp drain, kocher maneuver, laparoscopic, ligasure device, satinsky clamp, toldt, bulldogs, nephrectomy, renal parenchyma, resection, urethra, vicryl sutures, partial nephrectomy, gonadal vein, renal hilum, satinsky, renal, kidney, hilum, foley, endotracheal, "

 patient demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment for stroke., Consult - History and Phy., Neuropsychological Evaluation ,"reason for referral: , ms. a is a 60-year-old african-american female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in july.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,relevant background information:,  historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with ms. a.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,history of presenting problem:,  ms. a presented to the abc hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  neurological evaluation with dr. x confirmed left hemiparesis.  brain ct showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received tpa and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  these symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  she was transferred to the icu for monitoring.  ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ica and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ica.  on 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right mca/cva.  at discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all adls and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  she was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  she returned to the sinai er on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  brain ct on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  neurological examination with dr. y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,followup ct on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  mri could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  she was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that ms. a referred to this as a second stroke.,ms. a presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with dr. x on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  she demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  during the current interview, ms. a reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  she also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  when asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  she reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the social security agency that she works at.  note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  she also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,other medical history:  ,as mentioned, ms. a continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  she was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by dr. x on the need to use her cpap because she indicated she never used it at night.  she reported that since her appointment with dr. x, she has been using it ""every other night.""  when asked about daytime fatigue, ms. a initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  she reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  she receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,current medications: , aspirin 81 mg daily, colace 100 mg b.i.d., lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol mdi p.r.n.,substance use:,  ms. a denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  she used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,family medical history: , ms. a had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  she reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  her father has gout and blood clots.  siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and gi tumors.  she was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,social history: , ms. a completed high school degree.  she reported that she primarily obtained b's and c's in school.  she received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,she currently works for the social security administration in data processing.  as mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  she is now living on her own.  she has never driven.  she reported that she continues to perform adls independently such as cooking and cleaning.  she lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  she previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  she also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  she has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the bahamas at the end of october.,psychiatric history: , ms. a did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  she reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  she reported that this only ""comes and goes."",tasks administered:,clinical

at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  at this point, dr. x used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  dr. y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  dr. x and dr. y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with dr. y being on the lateral aspect of the area and dr. x on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  the tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  the patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  ultimately, dr. y and dr. x both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where dr. y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  dr. x then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  dr. y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  dr. y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  dr. y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  dr. x then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  the stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by dr. y and dr. x closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  this opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  dr. y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  electrocautery was used on the base.  there was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  dermabond and gelfoam were placed, and then dr. y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  dr. x then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 vicryl in 3 layers.  dr. y closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 rapide respectively.  a 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by dr. y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by dr. y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a foley catheter placed in the bladder.  the foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  a second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","urology, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,"

blue 12 mm height.,history of present illness: , the patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the office complaining of bilateral knee pain for a couple of years.  the patient complained of clicking noises and stiffness, which affected his daily activities of living.,procedure: , after all potential complications, risks as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure was discussed at length, the patient's informed consent was obtained.,operative extremities were then confirmed with the operating surgeons as well as the nursing staff, department of anesthesia, and the patient.  the patient was then transferred to preoperative area to operative suite #2 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  all bony prominences were well padded at this time.  at this time, department of anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  the patient was allowed in dvt study and the right extremity was in the esmarch study as well as the left.  the nonsterile tourniquet was then applied to the right upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the right upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated using 325 mmhg.  the patient was a consideration for a unicompartmental knee replacement.  so, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a limited midline longitudinal incision was made directly over the patella.  a sharp dissection was then taken down to the level of the fascia in line with the patella as well as the quadriceps tendon.  next, a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed using the #10 blade scalpel.  upon viewing of the articular surfaces, there was significant ware in the trochlear groove as well as the medial femoral condyle and it was elected to proceed with total knee replacement.  at this time, the skin incisions as well as the deep incisions were extended proximally and distally in a midline fashion.  total incision now measured approximately 25 cm.  retractors were placed.  next, attention was directed to establishing medial and lateral flaps of the proximal tibia.  reciprocating osteal elevator was used to establish soft tissue plane and then an electrocautery was then used to subperiosteal strip medially and laterally on the proximal tibia.  at this time, the patella was then everted.  the knee was flexed up to 90 degrees.  next, using the large drill bit, the femoral canal was then opened in appropriate position.  the intramedullary sizing guide was then placed and the knee was sized to a size f. at this time, the three degrees external rotation holes were then drilled after carefully assessing the epicondylar access as well as the white sideline.  the guide was then removed.  the intramedullary guide was then placed with nails holding the guide in three degrees of external rotation.  next, the anterior femoral resection guide was then placed and clamped into place using a pointed _________________ was then used to confirm that there would no notching performed.  next, soft tissue retractors were placed and an oscillating saw was used to make the anterior femoral cut.  upon checking, it was noted to be flat with no oscillations.  the anterior guide was then removed and the distal femoral resection guide was placed in five degrees of valgus.  it was secured in place using nails.  the intramedullary guide was then removed and the standard distal femoral cut was then made using oscillating saw.,this was then removed and the size f distal finishing femoral guide was then placed on the femur in proper position.  bony and soft tissue landmarks were confirmed and the resection guide was then held in place using nail as well as spring screws.  again, the collateral ligament retractors were then placed and the oscillating saw was used to make each of the anterior and posterior as well as each chamfer cut.  a reciprocating saw was then used to cut the trochlear cut and the peg holes were drilled as well.  the distal finishing guide was then removed and osteotome was then used to remove all resected bone.  the oscillating saw was then used to complete the femoral notch cut.  upon viewing, there appeared to be proper amount of bony resection and all bone was removed completely.  there was no posterior osteophytes noted and no fragments to the posterior aspect.  next, attention was directed towards the tibia.  the external tibial guide was reflected.  this was placed on the anterior tibia and held in place using nails after confirming the proper varus and valgus position.  the resection guide was then checked and appeared to be sufficient amount of resection in both medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.  next, collateral ligament retractors were placed as well as mcgill retractors for the pcl.  oscillating saw was then used to make the proximal tibial cut.  osteotome was used to remove this excess resected bone.  the laminar spreader was then used to check the flexion and extension.  the gaps appeared to be equal.  the external guide was then removed and trial components were placed to a size f femoral component and a 12 mm tibial component on a size 8 tray.  the knee was taken through range of motion and had very good flexion as well as full extension.  there appeared to be good varus and valgus stability as well.  next, attention was directed towards the patella.  there noted to be a sufficient ware and it was selected to replace the patella.  it was sized with caliper, pre-cut and noted to be 26 mm depth.  the sizing guide was then used and a size 51 resection guide selected.  a 51 mm reamer was then placed and sufficient amount of patella was then removed.  the calcar was then used to check again and there was noted to be 15 mm remaining.  the 38 mm patella guide was then placed on the patella.  it was noted to be in proper size and the three drill holes for the pegs were used.  a trial component was then placed.  the knee was taken through range of motion.  there was noted to be some subluxation lateral to the patellar component and a lateral release was performed.  after this, the component appeared to be tracking very well.  there remained a good range of motion in the knee and extension as well as flexion.  at this time, an ap x-ray of the knee was taken with the trial components in place.  upon viewing this x-ray, it appeared that the tibial cut was in neutral, all components in proper positioning.  the knee was then copiously irrigated and dried.  the knee was then flexed ___________ placed, and the peg drill guide was placed on the tibia in proper position, held in place with nails.,the four peg holes were then drilled.  the knee again was copiously irrigated and suction dried.  the final components were then selected again consisting of size f femoral components.  a peg size 8 tibial component, a 12 mm height articular surface, size blue, and a 38 mm 9.5 mm thickness all-poly patella.  polymethyl methacrylate was then prepared at this time.  the proximal tibia was dried and the cement was then pressed into place.  the cement was then placed on the backside of the tibial component and the tibial component was then impacted into proper positioning.  next, the proximal femur was cleaned and dried.  polymethyl methacrylate was placed on the resected portions of the femur as well as the backside of the femoral components.  this was then impacted in place as well.  at this time, all excess cement was removed from both the tibial and femoral components.  a size 12 mm trial tibial articular surface was then put in place.  the knee was reduced and held in loading position throughout the remaining drying position of the cement.  next, the resected patella was cleaned and dried.  the cement was placed on the patella as well as the backside of the patellar component.  the component was then put in proper positioning and held in place with a clamp.  all excess polymethyl methacrylate was removed from this area as well.  this was held until the cement had hardened sufficiently.  next, the knee was examined.  all excess cement was then removed.  the knee was taken through range of motion with sufficient range of motion as well as stability.  the final 12 mm height polyethylene tibial component was then put into place and snapped down in proper position.  again range of motion was noted to be sufficient.  the knee was copiously irrigated and suction dried once again.  a drain was then placed within the knee.  the wound was then closed first using #1 ethibond to close the arthrotomy oversewn with a #1 vicryl.  the knee was again copiously irrigated and dried.  the skin was closed using #2-0 vicryl in subcuticular fashion followed by staples on the skin.  the constavac was then _______ to the drain.  sterile dressing was applied consisting of adaptic, 4x4, abds, kerlix, and a 6-inch dupre roll from foot to thigh.  department of anesthesia then reversed the anesthetic.  the patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to postanesthesia care unit.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.","surgery, degenerative, arthritis, zimmer nexgen, all-poly, cruciate,

system.,description of the procedure:  ,the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  after adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  the right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmhg.  the right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  the right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  the incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  the incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  all the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  the conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,a lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  the same saw was used to perform the austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  the dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  the capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  two wires of the osteomed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  the wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  the two screws from the 3.0 osteomed system were inserted over the wires using ao technique.  one screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  to improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the osteomed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the osteomed 3.0 system.  upon insertion of the screw, using ao technique, the wire was removed.  the screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  the area was flushed copiously with saline.  then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and steri-strips were used to reinforce the incision.  attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  the incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  the incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  all the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  the capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,the 2.0 osteo-med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  upon insertion of the screw, using ao technique, the wire was then removed.  fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  then, 3-0 vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  then, 4-0 vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  attention was then directed at the level of the pip joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right pip joint.  the island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  the dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the pip joint.  a capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the pip joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  the area was copiously flushed with saline.  the capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 vicryl and 3-0 vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  a 5-0 prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  at this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and kling, stockinette, and ace bandage.  the patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,the patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  the patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  the patient was eventually discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with dr. x's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","surgery, austin-akin bunionectomy, weil osteotomy, internal screw fixation, first right

anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,operative procedure in detail: , after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  in addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  after applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery.  the abdomen was opened.  next, a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  in an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  next, we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver.  this was done and the stomach was freed up.  we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  at this point the stomach was freely mobile.  we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  a 2-0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz.  we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  we placed a 16-french red rubber catheter through this site.  we tied down in place.  we then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a witzel.  next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  this was done with #1 prolene.  we put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.,next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  we then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery.  next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  the lung was deflated.  we placed standard chest retractors.  next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  the azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  as mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  after doing this, we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  we used an automatic pursestring and applied.  we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors.  we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 gia stapler.  after doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery.  we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  we connected our anvil to the eea stapler.  this was then secured appropriately.  we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  we then fired the stapler.  we obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  this was closed with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  we then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 vicryl interrupted sutures.  we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  next, we placed two #28-french chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  we then closed the chest with #2 vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the lung was brought up.  we closed the muscle layers with #0 vicryl followed by #0 vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 vicryl and the skin with 4-0 monocryl.  sterile dressing was applied.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, ivor-lewis, esophagogastrectomy, jejunostomy, thoracotomy, dual-lumen tube, chest tubes,

graft.  then, cat scan models were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact regions for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region was scrubbed per routine.  surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient was draped.  xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml was infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  a primary incision was made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  release incisions were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,a full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  the contents of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramina were identified.  the hard palate was directly observed.  the facial tissues were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  similar features were reflected on the contralateral side.  the area was re-contoured with rongeurs.  the block of bone, which was formed and harvested from the left ilium was then placed and found to be stable.  a surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  a series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screws measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  particulate bone was then placed around the remaining block of bone.  a piece of alloderm mixed with croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which was centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood was then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  the tissues were expanded then with a tissue metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue was expanded, the tissues were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous sutures #3-0 gore-tex.  attention was brought then to the mandible.  1% xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were given.  a primary incision was made between the mental foramina and the residual crest of the ridge and reflected first to the lingual area observing the superior genial tubercle in the facial area degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  the anterior body was found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  a posterior tunnel was done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge was then degloved.  a tunnel was formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  a similar procedure was done on the contralateral side.  the tissues were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation was used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur was used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.  a block of bone was inserted between the mental foramina and fixative with three 16 cm screws first with a twist drill then followed with self-tapping 2 mm diameter titanium screws.  the block of bone was further re-contoured in situ.  particulate bone was then injected into the posterior tunnels bilaterally.  a piece of alloderm was placed over those particulate segments.  the tissues were approximated for primary closure using #3-0 gore-tex suture both interrupted and horizontal mattress in form.  the tissues were compressed for about four minutes to allow platelet clots to form and to help adhere the flap.,the estimated blood loss in the harvest of the hip was 100 cc.  the estimated blood loss in the intraoral procedure was 220 cc.  total blood loss

however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  he was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  the risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by dr. x and the consent is available on the chart for review.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  the wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  the wound's bases were fibrous.  they did not break the bone at this point.  they were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  after iv was established by the department of anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  it was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  a heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  therefore, a penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  next, an esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  the long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  the transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  this bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  this was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  the pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  this bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  the wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  next, osteoset beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  six beads were placed in the wound.  next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 vicryl.  the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,the esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  a standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, kerlix, kling, and a loosely applied ace wrap.  the patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  he was transported via a cart to the postanesthesia care unit.  his vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  he was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  he is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  he is to follow up with dr. x.  he was given emergency contact numbers.  he is to continue the vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.  the patient was discharged in stable condition.","surgery, osteomyelitis, proximal phalanx, distal phalanx, infected bone, proximal, bone, phalanx, healing, hallux, infected, tissue, distal,"

administered general anesthetic.  once adequately anesthetized, the right lower extremity was placed in a johnson knee holder.  care was ensured that all bony prominences were well padded and she was positioned and secured.  after adequately positioned, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  attention was then directed to creation of the arthroscopic portals, both medial and lateral portal were made for arthroscope and instrumentation respectively.  the arthroscope was advanced through the inferolateral portal taking in a suprapatellar pouch.  all compartments were then examined in sequential order with photodocumentation of each compartment.  the patella was noted to have grade-ii changes of the inferior surface, otherwise appeared to track within the trochlear groove.  there was mild grooving of the trochlear cartilage.  the medial gutter was visualized.  there was no evidence of loose body.  the medial compartment was then entered.  there was noted to be a large defect on the medial femoral condyle grade iii-iv chondromalacia changes with exposed bone in evidence of osteochondral displaced fragment.  there was also noted to be a

position with a safety belt across her lap.  copious amounts of webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  after adequate sedation by the department of anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% marcaine plain were injected in a mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  the foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  the foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an esmarch bandage.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmhg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  the stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,the incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  all vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  the capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  at this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  there was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  the abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  the lateral capsulotomy was performed.  the extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,at this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  the capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  the first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  a 0.45 k-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  this k-wire was used as an access guide for a juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  the sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  the osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  the cortical hinge was maintained.  a

was removed.  the foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  at this time, it was incised to perform an akin osteotomy.,original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  the incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  the capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  an akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  after where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  at 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  the #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  the remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  the area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  the area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  capsule was closed with #3-0 vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  a running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  steri-strips were applied.  total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  dressings consisted of owen silk, 4x4s, kling, kerlix.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,the patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  the patient was transferred back to the pacu with

sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the or table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  abdominal insufflation was performed.  there were significant adhesions noted.  a second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  after adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of toldt and mobilizing this medially.  the kidney was able to be palpated within gerota's fascia.  the psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  the uterus was grasped with a babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  the renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  there was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  we were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  an incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  a bookwalter retractor was placed.  the renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and bovie cautery.  the tissue was sent down to pathology for analysis.  please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  the renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  at this point, the indwelling double-j ureteral stent was removed.  at this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 vicryl suture was placed.  this was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  the back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 vicryl suture.  at this point, a double-j stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  the anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running vicryl suture.  renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  this was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 vicryl.  floseal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  a good hemostasis was noted.  a #10 blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  the initial trocar incision was closed with #0 vicryl suture.  the abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  the scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 vicryl suture.  the skin edges were then closed with staples.  please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  we placed the patient on iv antibiotics and pain medications.  we will obtain kub and x-rays for stent placement.  further recommendations to follow.","urology, retroperitoneal, fibrosis, pyeloplasty, laparoscopic, lysis of adhesions, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, laparoscopic

illness: , the patient is a 68-year-old woman whom i have been following, who has had angina.  in any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her.  i advised her to call 911, which she did.  while waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her

history: , the patient has been having arm pain for several months.  she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  however, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  on 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid lad lesion, circumflex normal, and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  the decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel.  she underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with i believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  she had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it

a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  in any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  we will continue her beta-blocker and i cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  aspirin, plavix, valsartan, lipitor, and norvasc.  i am going to add imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out mi, although there is a little suspicion.  i suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal lv function.  she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, claritin for allergies, and detrol la for urinary incontinence.,total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  all

 she had severe dyspareunia and chronic suprapelvic pain.  the patient had had a prior left salpingoophorectomy laparoscopically in 2004 for same disease process.  now, she presented with a recurrent right ovarian endometrioma and severe pelvic pain.  she desired surgical treatment.  she accepted risk of a complete hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, risk of injury to underlying organs.  the risks, benefits, and alternatives were clearly discussed with the patient as documented in the medical record.,description of findings: , absent left adnexa.  right ovary about 6 cm with chocolate

consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent smooth induction of general anesthesia.  she was placed in a supine position with a transurethral foley in place and compression stockings in place.  the abdomen and vagina were thoroughly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,a pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried down sharply to the underlying layer of fascia and peritoneum.  the peritoneum was bluntly entered and the incision extended caudally and cephaladly with good visualization of underlying organs.  next, exploration of the abdominal and pelvic organs revealed the above noted findings.  the uterus was enlarged and probably contained adenomyosis.  there were dense adhesions, and a large right endometrioma with a chocolate cyst-like material contained within.  the sigmoid colon was densely adhered to the cul-de-sac into the posterior aspect of the uterus.  a bookwalter retractor was placed into the incision, and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  next, a sharp and blunt dissection was used to free the extensive adhesions, and enterolysis was performed with very careful attention not to injure or denude the bowel.  next, the left round ligament and cornual region was divided, transected, and suture-ligated with 0 polysorb.  the anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and opened anteriorly to the level of the bladder.  the uterine arteries were skeletonized on the left, and these were suture-clamped and transected with 0 polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  next, the bladder flap was developed anteriorly, and the bladder peritoneum was sharply and bluntly dissected off of the lower uterus.,on the right, a similar procedure was performed.  the right round ligament was suture-ligated with 0 polysorb.  it was transected and divided with electrocautery.  the anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and developed anteriorly and posteriorly, and this area was relatively avascular.  the left infundibulopelvic ligament was identified.  it was cross-clamped and transected, suture-ligated with 0 polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  next, the uterine arteries were skeletonized on the right.  they were transected and suture-ligated with 0 polysorb.  the uterosacral ligaments were taken bilaterally and transected and suture-ligated with 0 polysorb.  the cardinal ligaments were taken near their insertion into the cervical and uterine tissue.  pedicles were sharply developed and suture-ligated with 0 polysorb.  next, the electrocautery was used to dissect the cervix anteriorly from the underlying vagina.  once entry into the vagina was made, the cervix and uterus were amputated with jorgensen scissors.  the vaginal cuff angles were suture-ligated with 0 polysorb and transfixed to the ipsilateral, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments for vaginal support.  the remainder of the vagina was closed with figure-of-eight sutures in an interrupted fashion with good hemostasis noted.,next, the right ovarian tissue was densely adherent to the colon.  it was sharply and bluntly dissected, and most of the right ovary and endometrioma was removed and dissected off completely; however, there is a quite possibility that small remnants of ovarian tissue were left behind.  the right ureter was seen and palpated.  it did not appear to be dilated and had good peristalsis noted.  next, the retractors were removed.  the laparotomy sponges were removed from the abdomen.  the rectus fascia was closed with 0 polysorb in a continuous running fashion with 2 sutures meeting in the midline.  the subcutaneous tissue was closed with 0 plain gut in an interrupted

 the patient is a 58-year-old african-american right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning., Consult - History and Phy., Neuropsychological Evaluation - 4 ,"reason for referral:,  the patient is a 58-year-old african-american right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x. she is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  the patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,relevant background information:  ,historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,history of presenting problem:,  the patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for hospital center for four years.  she was dismissed from this position in september 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  she continues to receive some compensation through fmla hours.  she said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from state services.  she said that these 90 days are up around the end of november.  she said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  she said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  she said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  she described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  she said that since september 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,in july of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, dr. y, ph.d.  he completed a comprehensive independent medical evaluation on 08/14/2009.  she said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  the patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  a copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  to summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, the patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  this suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  it concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy…  the patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  the prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  following her dismissal, the patient presented to her primary physician, henry fein, m.d., who referred her to dr. x for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  his neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  the patient scored 20/30 on the mini-mental status exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  a repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,imaging studies: , mri of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  note that the mri was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,current functioning:  ,the patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  when asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  she also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  she continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  she is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  she reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  she said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  she said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  she reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  she also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  she said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  dr. x's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  she said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,other medical history: , the patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  she denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  as mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  she also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  mri of the c-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at c7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at c6-c7.  mri of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  as mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  she thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  she also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, gerd, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  she has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  she did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,current medications:,  novolog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, topamax, lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin d, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin c.,substance use: , the patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  she drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,social history:  ,the patient was born and raised in north carolina.  she was the sixth of nine siblings.  her father was a chef.  he completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  her mother is 93 years old.  her last job was as a janitor.  she completed fourth grade.  she reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  the patient completed a bachelor of science in nursing through state university in 1979.  she denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  she was married for two years.  her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  she has two children ages 43 and 30.  her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in new york.  in school, the patient reported obtaining primarily a's and b's.  she said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  the patient worked for hospital center for four years.

as well as a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the osteomed screw fixation system.,description of the procedure:,  the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  after adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  the left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmhg.  the left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  the left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe.  the incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  the incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  all the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal.  the conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion.  a lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  the dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  the same saw was used to perform an austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  the dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  the capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction.  the same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 osteomed system upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using ao technique.  the wires were removed.  fixation on the table was found to be excellent.  reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical.  the remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw.  the area was copiously flushed with saline.  the periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 vicryl suture material, 4-0 vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  the incision site was reinforced with steri-strips.  at this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  the time was 45 minutes.  immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  the patient's incision was covered with xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and kling, stockinette, and an ace bandage.  the patient's left foot was then placed in a surgical shoe.  the patient was then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  the patient was given pain medication and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  the patient was discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with dr. x in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","surgery, internal screw

cells.,preoperative hemoglobin was less than 10.,drains:,  none.,complications:,  none.,description of procedure: , with the patient prepped and draped in a routine fashion in the prone position on laminae support, an x-ray was taken and demonstrated a needle at the t12-l1 interspace.  an incision was made over the posterior spinous process of t10, t11, t12, l1, and l2.  a weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of t10, t11, t12, l1, and l2.  an additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting bovie current osteotome and cobb elevator.  the cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at t12 was apparent.  initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in t11 and l1.  the inferior articular facet was removed at t11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle.  placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy.  the awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of t11.  a 40-mm click'x screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the t11 vertebral body.,attention was next turned to the l1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an am-8 dissecting tool, am attachment to the midas rex instrumentation.  the area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in l1.  using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of l1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length click'x synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the l1 vertebral body.,at this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the mri findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side.  attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at t12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis.  the anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the t12 was incised with cutting bovie current and the posterior spinous process at t12 removed with a leksell rongeur.  it was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at t11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at t12.,at this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and leksell rongeur.  there was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the t12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the t11-t12 interlaminar space.  additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at t12 and l1.  these facets were removed with 45-degree kerrison rongeur and leksell rongeur.  bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed.  the exiting nerve roots at t11 and t12 were visualized and followed with frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free.  hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation.,at this point, a frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the t11-t12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile.  a #4 penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac.  copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at t11 and l1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement.  the anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at t11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for t11 and at l1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint.,with the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed.  it was felt that distraction was not necessary.  a 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod.  the locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld.  fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at t11-t12 or t12-l1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws.  a crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened.,it should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at t11, t12, and l1 with am-8 dissecting tool, am attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints.  this was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods.,following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters.  gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 vicryl suture.  the fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  the patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.","neurosurgery, facetectomies, decompression, posterolateral fusion, synthes click'x system, decompressive laminectomy, leksell rongeur,

osteotomy with orthopro screw fixation.,anesthesia: , local with iv sedation.,hemostasis: , with pneumatic ankle cuff.,description of procedure: , the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  the right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmhg.  at this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  the incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  the incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  the capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  the capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  at this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  the tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  at this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  the extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  the entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  the area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  at this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  the incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  the incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  at this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  at this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  the osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an orthopro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  the screw was placed following proper technique.  the osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  a very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  the packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  the entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  at this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  the hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the mcbride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  at this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  the surgical sites were then dressed with sterile xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.  the tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal.  the patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.,the patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided.  the patient has also been warned a number of times the importance of elevation and no

could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  curettings were negative for malignancy.  the patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  the ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  there was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  no other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  the upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  the appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  the ileum was within normal limits with no meckel's diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  there was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,operative procedure:  the patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  a midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  with a #10 bard parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  the fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 bard parker blade after incision was made with mayo scissors.  a balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  this giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  the infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 vicryl suture.  the right round ligament was ligated with #0 vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  the infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  an attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  after this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  the bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 vicryl suture.  after removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with mayo scissors, and the straight ochsner was placed by #0 vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  the cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 bard parker blade knife and a curved ochsner was placed by #0 vicryl suture.  the cervix was again grasped with a lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 bard parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  a single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  the vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  the round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 vicryl suture.  the ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  the pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  the appendix was grasped with babcock forceps.  the mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with metzenbaum scissors.  the curved hemostats were placed with #00 vicryl suture.  the base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 bard parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 vicryl.  no bleeding was noted.  sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  all packs and retractors were removed.  the peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 pds, but prior to closure, a marshall-marchetti-krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 vicryl suture.  following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an allis forceps at the level of the bartholin glands.  an incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with metzenbaum scissors.  the flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  in this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 vicryl suture.  excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 vicryl suture.  the bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 vicryl suture.  the skin was

" patient with hip pain, osteoarthritis, lumbar spondylosis, chronic sacroiliitis, etc.", SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes, Chiropractic Progress Note ,"chief complaint:  ,hip pain.,history of presenting illness:  ,the patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the pain management clinic, as well as from my residency training program, san francisco. we have worked collaboratively for many years at the pain management clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  she reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  in essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  she was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  with time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in san francisco in her mid 30s by dr. v, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at hospital.  she was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  most of this was focused on her si joints.  at that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  this was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  she was seen at the pain center by dr. r with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  she was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  medications at that time were salicylate and ultram.,when she returned to portland in 1996, she was then working for dr. b.  she was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  orthotics were provided.  she was given paxil and tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  during this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  she has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  she currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  she is establishing care with dr. s, of rheumatology for her ongoing care.  up until today, her pain medications were being written by dr. y prior to establishing with dr. l.,pain management in town had been first provided by the office of dr. f. under his care, followup mris were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  a number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  she then transferred her care to ab cd, fnp under the direction of dr. k.  her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,past medical history:  ,1.  attention deficit disorder.,2.  tmj arthropathy.,3.  migraines.,4.  osteoarthritis as described above.,past surgical history:,1.  cystectomies.,2.

neurological history.  her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  in spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved ""honors in school"" and ""looked smart.""  she reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  at 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  she reported that she will frequently ""bang her head against the wall"" to relieve the pain.  the patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  at 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  she reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and ""thrown two and a half city blocks.""  the patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  she reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  in 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  these episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,the patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  she reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  these episodes diminished from 2002 to june 2008.  when making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  she reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  a second episode occurred on july 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  she was admitted to sinai hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  her eeg and head ct were considered to be completely normal.  she did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour eeg.  she reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being

a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of jack daniel.  she stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  in 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  the patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,the patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  she reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  she finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  she experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  she reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  she said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  at the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  the patient is living with her biological mother.

 congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax and rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.   diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.  , Surgery, Abdominal Exploration ,"preoperative diagnoses:  ,1.  congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.,2.  rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.,postoperative diagnoses: , diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.,anesthesia: , general.,indication:  ,the patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  the patient has been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  last week, dr. x took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  dr. x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  this was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  we met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.,operative findings:  ,the patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  there was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but i did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.,the lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  they were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  they were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  no other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,description of operation:  ,the patient was brought from the pediatric intensive care unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  we conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  as the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  the bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  the small bowel from the ligament of treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for the patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  we suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 pds on the posterior sheath and 3-0 pds on the anterior rectus sheath.  subcuticular 5-0 monocryl and steri-strips were used for skin closure.,the patient tolerated the procedure well.  he lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 ml of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  the patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an intestinal transplantation center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.","surgery,

however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  the redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  it was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  the brainstem was identified above the complex.  similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  there were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  the lateral pontine vein was maintained.  microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  a number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  this then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  a number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  the nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  the tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  the cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  the tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  at this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  there was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  all the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  dr. x then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,i then scrubbed back into case once dr. x had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  there was no tumor remaining at this point.  i placed some norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  an intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  there was no bleeding.  the nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  the dura was then closed with 4-0 nurolons in interrupted fashion.  a muscle plug was used over one area.  duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by hemaseel.  gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  the wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  o vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,the patient was extubated and taken to the icu in stable condition.","neurosurgery, suboccipital, craniectomy, microscope, cranioplasty, acoustic neuroma, cerebellar peduncle, nerve complex, brainstem, nurolon, cavitron, kerrison, leksell, lateral pontine vein, suboccipital craniectomy, nerve, tumor"

is an 87-year-old caucasian female who presented to abcd general hospital emergency room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall.  the patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell.  the patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the emergency room department as well as department of orthopedics while in the emergency room.  at that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a robert-jones splint.  after complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,procedure:  ,after all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained.  the upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and department of anesthesia.  the patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the operative suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  at this time, the department of anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation.  all bony prominences were well padded at this time.  a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient.  this was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmhg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes.  next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle.  a sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.  once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified.  the bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site.  the wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position.  there was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone.  it was held in place with reduction forceps.  a six hole one-third tubular synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation.  it was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula.  next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each.  the most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length.  next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole.  the most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length.  next the xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position.  there was no lateralization of the joints.  attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle.  again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus.  again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site.  the retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures.  once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum.  the fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus.  there appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies.  next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  the medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm k-wire.  next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length.  these appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position.  again, xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws.  they were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint.  at this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  the wounds were then closed using #2-0 vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin.  a sterile dressing was applied consistent with adaptic, 4x4s, kerlix, and webril.  a robert-jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity.  this was covered by a 4-inch depuy dressing.  at this time, the department of anesthesia reversed the sedation.  the patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the postanesthetic care unit.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  there were no

blue 12 mm height.,history of present illness: , the patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the office complaining of bilateral knee pain for a couple of years.  the patient complained of clicking noises and stiffness, which affected his daily activities of living.,procedure: , after all potential complications, risks as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure was discussed at length, the patient's informed consent was obtained.,operative extremities were then confirmed with the operating surgeons as well as the nursing staff, department of anesthesia, and the patient.  the patient was then transferred to preoperative area to operative suite #2 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  all bony prominences were well padded at this time.  at this time, department of anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  the patient was allowed in dvt study and the right extremity was in the esmarch study as well as the left.  the nonsterile tourniquet was then applied to the right upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the right upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated using 325 mmhg.  the patient was a consideration for a unicompartmental knee replacement.  so, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a limited midline longitudinal incision was made directly over the patella.  a sharp dissection was then taken down to the level of the fascia in line with the patella as well as the quadriceps tendon.  next, a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed using the #10 blade scalpel.  upon viewing of the articular surfaces, there was significant ware in the trochlear groove as well as the medial femoral condyle and it was elected to proceed with total knee replacement.  at this time, the skin incisions as well as the deep incisions were extended proximally and distally in a midline fashion.  total incision now measured approximately 25 cm.  retractors were placed.  next, attention was directed to establishing medial and lateral flaps of the proximal tibia.  reciprocating osteal elevator was used to establish soft tissue plane and then an electrocautery was then used to subperiosteal strip medially and laterally on the proximal tibia.  at this time, the patella was then everted.  the knee was flexed up to 90 degrees.  next, using the large drill bit, the femoral canal was then opened in appropriate position.  the intramedullary sizing guide was then placed and the knee was sized to a size f. at this time, the three degrees external rotation holes were then drilled after carefully assessing the epicondylar access as well as the white sideline.  the guide was then removed.  the intramedullary guide was then placed with nails holding the guide in three degrees of external rotation.  next, the anterior femoral resection guide was then placed and clamped into place using a pointed _________________ was then used to confirm that there would no notching performed.  next, soft tissue retractors were placed and an oscillating saw was used to make the anterior femoral cut.  upon checking, it was noted to be flat with no oscillations.  the anterior guide was then removed and the distal femoral resection guide was placed in five degrees of valgus.  it was secured in place using nails.  the intramedullary guide was then removed and the standard distal femoral cut was then made using oscillating saw.,this was then removed and the size f distal finishing femoral guide was then placed on the femur in proper position.  bony and soft tissue landmarks were confirmed and the resection guide was then held in place using nail as well as spring screws.  again, the collateral ligament retractors were then placed and the oscillating saw was used to make each of the anterior and posterior as well as each chamfer cut.  a reciprocating saw was then used to cut the trochlear cut and the peg holes were drilled as well.  the distal finishing guide was then removed and osteotome was then used to remove all resected bone.  the oscillating saw was then used to complete the femoral notch cut.  upon viewing, there appeared to be proper amount of bony resection and all bone was removed completely.  there was no posterior osteophytes noted and no fragments to the posterior aspect.  next, attention was directed towards the tibia.  the external tibial guide was reflected.  this was placed on the anterior tibia and held in place using nails after confirming the proper varus and valgus position.  the resection guide was then checked and appeared to be sufficient amount of resection in both medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.  next, collateral ligament retractors were placed as well as mcgill retractors for the pcl.  oscillating saw was then used to make the proximal tibial cut.  osteotome was used to remove this excess resected bone.  the laminar spreader was then used to check the flexion and extension.  the gaps appeared to be equal.  the external guide was then removed and trial components were placed to a size f femoral component and a 12 mm tibial component on a size 8 tray.  the knee was taken through range of motion and had very good flexion as well as full extension.  there appeared to be good varus and valgus stability as well.  next, attention was directed towards the patella.  there noted to be a sufficient ware and it was selected to replace the patella.  it was sized with caliper, pre-cut and noted to be 26 mm depth.  the sizing guide was then used and a size 51 resection guide selected.  a 51 mm reamer was then placed and sufficient amount of patella was then removed.  the calcar was then used to check again and there was noted to be 15 mm remaining.  the 38 mm patella guide was then placed on the patella.  it was noted to be in proper size and the three drill holes for the pegs were used.  a trial component was then placed.  the knee was taken through range of motion.  there was noted to be some subluxation lateral to the patellar component and a lateral release was performed.  after this, the component appeared to be tracking very well.  there remained a good range of motion in the knee and extension as well as flexion.  at this time, an ap x-ray of the knee was taken with the trial components in place.  upon viewing this x-ray, it appeared that the tibial cut was in neutral, all components in proper positioning.  the knee was then copiously irrigated and dried.  the knee was then flexed ___________ placed, and the peg drill guide was placed on the tibia in proper position, held in place with nails.,the four peg holes were then drilled.  the knee again was copiously irrigated and suction dried.  the final components were then selected again consisting of size f femoral components.  a peg size 8 tibial component, a 12 mm height articular surface, size blue, and a 38 mm 9.5 mm thickness all-poly patella.  polymethyl methacrylate was then prepared at this time.  the proximal tibia was dried and the cement was then pressed into place.  the cement was then placed on the backside of the tibial component and the tibial component was then impacted into proper positioning.  next, the proximal femur was cleaned and dried.  polymethyl methacrylate was placed on the resected portions of the femur as well as the backside of the femoral components.  this was then impacted in place as well.  at this time, all excess cement was removed from both the tibial and femoral components.  a size 12 mm trial tibial articular surface was then put in place.  the knee was reduced and held in loading position throughout the remaining drying position of the cement.  next, the resected patella was cleaned and dried.  the cement was placed on the patella as well as the backside of the patellar component.  the component was then put in proper positioning and held in place with a clamp.  all excess polymethyl methacrylate was removed from this area as well.  this was held until the cement had hardened sufficiently.  next, the knee was examined.  all excess cement was then removed.  the knee was taken through range of motion with sufficient range of motion as well as stability.  the final 12 mm height polyethylene tibial component was then put into place and snapped down in proper position.  again range of motion was noted to be sufficient.  the knee was copiously irrigated and suction dried once again.  a drain was then placed within the knee.  the wound was then closed first using #1 ethibond to close the arthrotomy oversewn with a #1 vicryl.  the knee was again copiously irrigated and dried.  the skin was closed using #2-0 vicryl in subcuticular fashion followed by staples on the skin.  the constavac was then _______ to the drain.  sterile dressing was applied consisting of adaptic, 4x4, abds, kerlix, and a 6-inch dupre roll from foot to thigh.  department of anesthesia then reversed the anesthetic.  the patient was transferred back to

deformity of the right foot.,anesthesia:,  monitored anesthesia care with 15 ml of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain.,estimated blood loss:,  less than 10 ml.,hemostasis:,  right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmhg for 35 minutes.,materials used: , 3-0 vicryl, 4-0 vicryl, and two partially threaded cannulated screws from 3.0 osteomed system for internal fixation.,injectables:  ,ancef 1 g iv 30 minutes preoperatively.,description of the procedure: , the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  after adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  the right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmhg.  the right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  the right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  the incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  all the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  the decision was thus made to perform a youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  the osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a v-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  the two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  the wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to pathology for further examination.  the head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the osteomed system.  the wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  the wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the osteomed system.  the 2 screws were inserted using ao technique.  upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  the area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  the cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  the capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl suture material, 4-0 vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  steri-strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  at this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  the patient's surgical site was then covered with xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and kling, stockinette, and ace bandage.  the patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  the patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  the patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.  the patient was eventually discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with dr. x's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","surgery, hallux limitus deformity, metatarsophalangeal joint, plantar cut, youngswick osteotomy, dorsal cuts, ankle tourniquet, proximal phalanx, anesthesia, tourniquet, youngswick,

66-year-old caucasian female who presented to abcd general hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.  the patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  she had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  she was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  the patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  she was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,operative procedure:  ,the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  the patient received preoperative antibiotics with kefzol.  the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with betadine solution.  the patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  utilizing a veress needle, the veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the co2 insufflation.  the abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmhg.  after adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  a subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  all ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  after all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  adhesions adjacent were taken down with a maryland dissector.  once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  this helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  utilizing maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  utilizing endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  the gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  no evidence of stones were visualized.  once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an endocatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into endocatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  this was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  a small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  this was also taken and sent off as specimen.  the abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  all laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.  the abdomen was de-insufflated.  utilizing #0 vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.  all incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed vicryl.  two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures.  the areas were cleaned and dried.  steri-strips were placed.  on the incisions, sterile dressing was applied.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  she was extubated following procedure.  she is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with dr. x within one week for a follow-up evaluation.","gastroenterology, excision of liver cyst, gallbladder, omentum, cystic artery, gallstone, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cystic duct, liver cyst, liver, abdomen, electrocautery,

function by visual inspection.,procedure: , after the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  a median sternotomy incision was performed.  dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  a subtotal thymectomy was performed.  systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  a small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  atrial appendage.  the aorta was then cannulated with an 8-french aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-french polystan right-angle cannula.  with an act greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  during cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  after 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-french catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-french polystan venous cannula.  the heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  it was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  the two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 pds suture.  following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  a right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  the atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 prolene suture.  the usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 prolene sutures.  the venous cannula was reinserted.  cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-french blake drains.  venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  all cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  with good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  the patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,i was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  given the magnitude of the operation, the

having myocardial infarction.  she was then transferred to beaumont hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  the patient was treated for the abscess in beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in warren, michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,the patient subsequently recovered in a cardiac rehab facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of august, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an mri, which showed record signal change.  the patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  when she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  she was concerned and called the orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  i was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  on clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  the patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  long track signs are absent.  sensory level is at the c4 dermatome.  rectal tone is absent.  i discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  we discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  they are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,operative procedure:  ,the patient was taken to or #1 at abcd general hospital on a gurney.  department of anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  a foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  the patient was log rolled in a prone position on the jackson table.  bony prominences were well padded.  the patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  at this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the previous skin incision was reopened.  at this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  all sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  the self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  next, the epidural space was encountered.  there was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  a curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  the inferior edge of the c2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of t1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  the walls of the wound were explored.  there was no active bleeding.  retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  a #19 french hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  fascia was reapproximated with #1 vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 vicryl sutures.  steri-strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  the patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  she remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  once in the recovery room, she was alert.  she was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  prognosis for this patient is guarded.","neurology,

hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  she was referred to dr. x for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  the patient reports an extensive neurological history.  her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  in spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved ""honors in school"" and ""looked smart.""  she reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  at 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  she reported that she will frequently ""bang her head against the wall"" to relieve the pain.  the patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  at 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  she reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and ""thrown two and a half city blocks.""  the patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  she reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  in 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  these episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,the patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  she reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  these episodes diminished from 2002 to june 2008.  when making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  she reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  a second episode occurred on july 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  she was admitted to sinai hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  her eeg and head ct were considered to be completely normal.  she did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour eeg.  she reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  she stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and ""tunnel vision"" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was ""spazzing out"" on the floor.  during these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,the patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  she reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of jack daniel.  she stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  in 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  the patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,the patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  she reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  she finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  she experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  she reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  she said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  at the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  the patient is living with her biological mother.

 endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma.  endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus., Neurology, Pituitary Adenomectomy ,"preoperative diagnosis: , large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,postoperative diagnosis:,  large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,operation performed: , endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,indications for procedure: , this man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  he did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  for this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  the high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  many risks including csf leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  after clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,procedure:  ,the patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  the back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,a 14-gauge tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  clear and colorless csf issued forth.  a catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  the catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,this no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  this improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,the patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  he was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  the fluoroscope c-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  the metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,a transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  hemostasis was obtained.  the wound was carefully closed in layers.,i then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  the middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  needle bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  i entered into the sphenoid.,there was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and i slowly and carefully worked through all this.  i identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which i exposed the very medial portion of.  the opening was wide until i had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,the operating microscope was then utilized.  working under magnification, i used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,the dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and i immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  a frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,slowly and meticulously, i worked to remove the tumor.  i used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  the tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,slowly and carefully, i systematically entered the sellar contents until i could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  there appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  it was consistent with what we saw on the mri imaging.,the portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  a large amount of this was removed.  there was a csf leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,under high magnification, i actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  while there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  in fact, i reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,i reasoned that i had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  attention was therefore turned to closure.,the wound was copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  i asked anesthesiology to perform a valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  i placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  using a polypropylene insert, i reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,duraseal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and duraseal.,i inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  the middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  there was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open

 thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.  the patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  the pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis., Pediatrics - Neonatal, Thyroid Mass Consult ,"reason for consultation: , thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.,history of present illness:  ,the patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the pediatric endocrinology department by dr. x for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  the patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  an ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  when it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the pediatric endocrinology department and had an evaluation there.  the patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  the patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  she has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  there is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  she has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  there have been no skin changes.  historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,past medical history:,  essentially unremarkable.  the patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  she has had no prior surgical procedures.,immunizations: , current and up to date.,allergies: , she has no known drug allergies.,current medications:  ,currently taking no routine medications.  she describes her pain level currently as zero.,family history: , there is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  this was done in tijuana.  his mom is from central portion of mexico.  there is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,social history:  ,the patient is a junior at hoover high school.  she lives with her mom in fresno.,review of systems: , a careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,physical examination:,general:  the patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  she was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,heent:  the head and neck examination is most significant.  there is mild amount of facial acne.  the patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,neck:  there is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  a firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  this mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that i can determine.  there are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  no supraclavicular nodes were noted.,chest:  excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,lungs:  clear.,cardiovascular:  normal.  there is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,abdomen:  benign.,extremities:  extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,genitourinary:  external genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  this is same as too for her rectal examination.,skin:  there is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,neurologic:  normal and no focal deficits.  her voice is strong and clear.  there is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,diagnostic studies: , i reviewed laboratory data from the diagnostics lab, which included a mild abnormality in the ast at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  t4 and tsh levels were recorded as normal.  free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  there was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  a urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  a chest x-ray was obtained, which i personally reviewed.  there is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,impression/plan: , the patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  the pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  i spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  during this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  we talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  we also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  i answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  i also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  this will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  the radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  i did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin d in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  all of the family's questions have been answered.  this is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  i have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  we are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.",

months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and hartmann's colostomy.,procedure:  ,the patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  a cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 french ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  the cystoscope was removed, a foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and foley.  at this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade bard-parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.,the incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  at this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  the rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  first, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  the remainder of the excess tissue was closed with metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the t8 ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  the #29 eea was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the eea was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  the eea was then fired.  once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  a doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  colonoscope was introduced.  no bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  there was no evidence of bleeding.  pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  the scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  first, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 vicryl suture.  the peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 vicryl suture.  then, the midline incision was closed with a loop pds in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.  subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.,the iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well.  the patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization.  the left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure.  _____ were performed.  lysis of adhesions were performed.  reversal of colostomy and eea anastomosis #29 ethicon.","surgery, reversal of hartmann's colostomy, flexible sigmoidoscopy,

 cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis - endstage renal disease., Surgery, Renal Transplant - Cadaveric ,"history of present illness:  ,the patient is a 50-year-old african american female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on june 22, 2007.  the patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  after appropriate cross match and workup of hla typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,preoperative diagnosis:,  endstage renal disease.,postoperative diagnosis: , endstage renal disease.,procedure:,  cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,estimated blood loss: , 400 ml.,fluids:  ,one liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,anesthesia:  ,general endotracheal.,specimen:  ,none.,drain: , none.,complications: , none.,the patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  after adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the asis down to the suprapubic space.  after this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  camper's and scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  the external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  after these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  after the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  after the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  this was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  the round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  the dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  this alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  after the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  the right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  after the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  an additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  this was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  the dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  at this time, satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  this was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  the heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  the renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  a 5-0 double-ended prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 prolene, these were tied down and secured.  the renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  the dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  after such time the 5-0 prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  after this was done and the artery was secured, the satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  the flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  the bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  the kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  at this time, all satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  the dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  this was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  at this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  this was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  additional vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  at this time, an ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  this was inspected and noted for proper control.  irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  at this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  the kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  a 1-0 prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  this was secured and knots were dumped.  subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running monocryl.  the patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the dunn icu where he was noted to be stable.

allen stirrups.  the vaginal portion of the procedure included placement of a zumi uterine manipulator with a koh colpotomy ring and a vaginal occluder balloon.,the laparoscopic port sites were anesthetized with intradermal injection of 0.25% marcaine.  there were five ports placed, including a 3-mm left subcostal port, a 10-mm umbilical port, a 10-mm suprapubic port, and 5-mm right and left lower quadrant ports.  the veress needle was placed through a small incision at the base of the umbilicus, and a pneumoperitoneum was insufflated without difficulty.  the 3-mm port was then placed in the left subcostal position without difficulty, and a 3-mm scope was placed.  there were no adhesions underlying the previous vertical midline scar.  the 10-mm port was placed in the umbilicus, and the laparoscope was inserted.  remaining ports were placed under direct laparoscopic guidance.  washings were obtained from the pelvis, and the abdomen was explored with the laparoscope, with findings as noted.,attention was then turned to lymphadenectomy.  an incision in the retroperitoneum was made over the right common iliac artery, extending up the aorta to the retroperitoneal duodenum.  the lymph node bundle was elevated from the aorta and the anterior vena cava until the retroperitoneal duodenum had been reached.  pedicles were sealed and divided with bipolar cutting forceps.  excellent hemostasis was noted.  boundaries of dissection included the ureters laterally, common ileac arteries at uterine crossover inferiorly, and the retroperitoneal duodenum superiorly with careful preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery.  right and left pelvic retroperitoneal spaces were then opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament with the bipolar cutting forceps.  the retroperitoneal space was then opened and the lymph nodes were dissected, with boundaries of dissection being the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, psoas muscle laterally, inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  the posterior boundary was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  the left common iliac lymph node was elevated and removed using the same technique.,attention was then turned to the laparoscopic hysterectomy.  the right infundibulopelvic ligament was divided using the bipolar cutting forceps.  the mesovarium was skeletonized.  a bladder flap was mobilized by dividing the round ligaments using the bipolar cutting forceps, and the peritoneum on the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.  once the koh colpotomy ring was skeletonized and in position, the uterine arteries were sealed using the bipolar forceps at the level of the colpotomy ring.  the vagina was transected using a monopolar hook (or bipolar spatula), resulting in separation of the uterus and attached tubes and ovaries.  the uterus, tubes, and ovaries were then delivered through the vagina, and the pneumo-occluder balloon was reinserted to maintain pneumoperitoneum.  the vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches of 0-vicryl using the endo-stitch device.  the abdomen was irrigated, and excellent hemostasis was noted.,the insufflation pressure was reduced, and no evidence of bleeding was seen.  the suprapubic port was then removed,

 nissen fundoplication.   a 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. , Surgery, Nissen Fundoplication ,"procedure performed: , nissen fundoplication.,description of procedure: , after informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  the patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  teds and venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,a 52-french bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  a 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  the fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  a 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  two sutures of 0 vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmhg.  a 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,the remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  a total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  all of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  the patient was then placed in reverse trendelenburg position.,the triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  the gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  the dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  the phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  this incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,the liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  the pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  this allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  at its left border, the left crus was identified.  the dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  the gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  by dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,the next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  this required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  this dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  the esophagus was lifted by a babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  a one-half inch penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  the retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,the 52-french bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,the last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  with anterior retraction on the esophagus using the penrose drain, a babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  it was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  the,52-french bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  the skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  a dressing was then applied.  all surgical counts were reported as correct.,having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.","surgery, umbilicus, insufflation, phrenoesophageal membrane, nissen fundoplication, gastric pouch, esophagus, penrose, antireflux, nissen, fundoplication, trocars, ligament,"

placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  all bony prominences were padded.  the right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar.,serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum.  subacromial space was entered.  visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back.  it was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur.  rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact.  thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed.  the burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out.  the width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint.,the patient tolerated the procedure very well.  the shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris.  the wound was closed with 3-0 prolene.  sterile compressive dressing applied.,the patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard betadine prep.,the attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmhg for about 25 minutes.  volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis.  tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures.,cautery was used for hemostasis.  the never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down.  the patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well.  the hand was then irrigated, closed with monocryl and prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated.,attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars.  after entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus.  these were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver.  there was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee.  there was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with celestone and marcaine with epinephrine.,the patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0

cannulated screws of the osteomed system, one 18-mm partially treaded cannulated screw of the osteomed system of the 3.0 size.  one 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the osteomed system.,description of the procedure:  ,the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  after adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  the right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmhg.  the right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  the right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  the incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  the incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  all the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  the conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,a lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  the same saw was used to perform the austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  the dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  the capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  two wires of the osteomed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  the wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  the two screws from the 3.0 osteomed system were inserted over the wires using ao technique.  one screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  to improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the osteomed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the osteomed 3.0 system.  upon insertion of the screw, using ao technique, the wire was removed.  the screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  the area was flushed copiously with saline.  then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and steri-strips were used to reinforce the incision.  attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  the incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  the incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  all the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  the capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,the 2.0 osteo-med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  upon insertion of the screw, using ao technique, the wire was then removed.  fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  then, 3-0 vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  then, 4-0 vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  attention was then directed at the level of the pip joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right pip joint.  the island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  the dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the pip joint.  a capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the pip joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  the area was copiously flushed with saline.  the capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 vicryl and 3-0 vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  a 5-0 prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  at this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and kling, stockinette, and ace bandage.  the patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,the patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  the patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  the patient was eventually discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with dr. x's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","orthopedic, austin-akin bunionectomy, weil osteotomy, internal screw fixation, first right

l5-s1.,history: , this is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the s1 nerve root distribution.  the patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  he denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the s1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  after an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,procedure detail:  ,he was wheeled back to operating room #5 at abcd general hospital on 08/28/03.  after a general anesthetic was administered, a foley catheter was inserted.,the patient was then turned prone on the jackson table.  all of his bony prominences were well-padded.  at this time, a myelogram was then performed.  after the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  the needle was localized to the level of l3-l4 region.  once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  at this time, approximately 10 cc of conray injected into the thecal sac.  the patient was then placed in the reversed trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  the myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of l5-s1 on the left.  there was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the ap and the lateral projections using c-arm fluoroscopy.  at this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  a long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  the surgery was going to be on the left.  once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the l5-s1 nerve root region.  at this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  at this time, a weitlaner was inserted.  bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  we further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  a cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  at this time, a taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  suction as well as bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  at this time, a small kerrison rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the s1 nerve root, which was compressive.  we removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the s1 nerve root.  a nerve root retractor was then placed.  identification of disc space was then performed.  a #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  a small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  the part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,at this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  we then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  at this time, a small piece of gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  we did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  sterile

noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  the medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen.  the articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,history:  ,this is a 36-year-old caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  she has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  she has failed conservative therapy.  it was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  she elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  all risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  she was in agreement with the treatment plan.,procedure: , on 09/04/03, she was taken to operating room at abcd general hospital.  she was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the anesthesia department.  her leg was placed in a johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  a stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  intraoperative pictures were obtained.  the above findings were noted.  second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  an arthroscopic bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  a release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the bovie.  hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  next, the knee was suctioned dry.  an esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmhg.  an oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  the subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  the retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  the patellar tendon was identified.  the lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  the tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  it was then held in place with a steinmann pin.  following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  there was excellent fixation noted.  the q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  she was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  the medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  the retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 vicryl.  subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 vicryl.  skin was closed with #4-0 vicryl running pds suture.  sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  she was placed in a donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  it was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  she was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint.  she will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia.","surgery, diagnostic arthroscopy, patellofemoral malalignment

" patient has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.", Consult - History and Phy., Neurologic Consultation - 2 ,"reason for visit:  ,the patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by dr. x.  the patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  he provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,history of present illness: , he has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  when i asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  he is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,according to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  at first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  they did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  as time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  he started to shuffle.  he started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since july of 2006.  at this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  he frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  he has not fallen in the last month.  he did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  his family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  he has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  his handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,in regard to the bladder, he states, ""i wet the bed.""  in talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  he was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  this was treated by dr. y.  dr. x does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  the patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  his wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  he has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,he has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,in regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  his wife took over his medications about two years ago.  she stopped his driving about three years ago.  she discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  apparently, he did not object.  at this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  he needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  he is a retired office machine repairman.  he is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,he has not had pt or ot and has not been treated with medications for parkinson's disease or alzheimer's disease.  he has been treated for the

pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  he had a period of depression in 1999 and was on prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  he used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  this was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  she states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,social history:  ,he quit smoking in 1968.  his current weight is 183 pounds.  his tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,family history:  ,his grandfather had arthritis.  his father had parkinson's disease.  his mother had heart disease and a sister has

aneurysm, which was clipped.  the patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07.  this resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow.  she was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time mri of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear.  she did have a previous mri of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left c6-c7 level.  based on this, negative mri of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at c6-c7 level.  operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her.  risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma.  there is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  there is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics.  however, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room.  should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft.  there is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery.  there is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid.  there is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  there is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure.  she understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed.,description of procedure: , the patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  after smooth induction and intubation, a foley catheter was inserted.  monitoring leads were placed by premier neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case.  the emgs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation.  after completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension.  the head was supported on a foam doughnut.  the right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side.  a linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm.  the area was then prepped with duraprep.,after sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision.  the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles.  dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath.  the prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply.  a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the c6-c7 interspace.  proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of c6 and c7.  self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  the annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr.  the interior endplate of c6 and superior endplate of c7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of c6 and the posterior superior edge of c7.  there was note of a new osteophyte on the left c6-c7 foramen.  this was carefully drilled down.  after decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders.  they were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with gelfoam.  after this was completed, valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any csf leakage.  a 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with vitoss.  the plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws.  irrigation of the area was done.  a round french 10 jp drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  the wound was then closed in layers with vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis.  the wound was reinforced with dermabond.  the catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site.  c-collar was placed and the patient was

dissection zones 2 and 3., Neurosurgery, Skull Base Reconstruction ,"preoperative diagnosis:,  squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,postoperative diagnosis: , squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,procedure: , right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal.,description of procedure:  ,the patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position.  general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  the neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  the neck was prepped as well.  after this was performed, i made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  a wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  after this was performed, i used the bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  the condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  the neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  the neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  the external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  a large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  i then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  it became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore i did use the router, i mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  the internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and i drilled carotid canal up until it made.  i dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  once this was dissected out, dr. x entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  for details, please see his operative note.,after dr. x had completed the resection, i then harvested the rectus free flap.  a skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  the skin paddle was incised with the bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  the sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  the skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 vicryl.  the anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  the vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  the muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large hemoclips on each vessel.  the wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  the rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  the inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 ethilon as well.  there was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  the wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  the eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  the muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  i removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  the wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with skin staples.  there was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  the skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,the abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  the patient was then turned over to the neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  the patient was then transferred to the pacu in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.","neurosurgery, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath,

definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis.  she did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also has a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy.  she has tried lupron and did stop secondary to the side effects.,procedure in detail: , after informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed under general anesthesia.  she was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position.  an indwelling foley catheter was placed.  with the skin knife, an incision was made removing the old cicatrix.  a bovie was used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which was incised in the midline and extended with the bovie.  the rectus muscle was then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior as well as the inferior aspect using the bovie.  the rectus muscle was then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum was entered bluntly.  the peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder.  at this point, the intraabdominal cavity was manually explored and the above findings were noted.  a lahey clamp was then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus was brought to the surgical field.  the bowel was then packed with moist laparotomy sponges.  prior to this, the filmy adhesions leftover were taken down.  at this point, the left round ligament was identified, grasped with two hemostats, transected, and suture ligated with #0 vicryl.  at this point, the broad ligament was dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap was created.  the posterior aspect of the peritoneum was also dissected.  at this point, the infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated and three tie of #0 vicryl was used to isolate the pedicle.  two hemostats were then placed across the pedicle and this was transected with the scalpel.  this was then suture ligated in heaney fashion.  the right round ligament was then identified and in the similar fashion, two hemostats were placed across the round ligament and using the mayo scissors the round ligament was transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly as well as dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament.  this was then ligated with three tie of #0 vicryl.  also incorporated in this was the remnant from the previous right salpingo-oophorectomy.  at this point, the bladder flap was further created with sharp dissection as well as the moist ray-tech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervix.,the left uterine artery was then skeletonized and a straight heaney was placed.  in a similar fashion, the contralateral uterine artery was skeletonized and straight heaney clamp was placed.  these ligaments bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left heaney stitch.  at this point, curved masterson was used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex, thus was transected and suture ligated.  straight masterson was then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this was also transected and suture ligated.  prior to ligating the uterine arteries, the uterosacral arteries were tagged bilaterally with #0 vicryl.  at this point, the roticulator was placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix.  the roticulator was then clamped and removed and the staple line was in place.  this was found to be hemostatic.  a suture was then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex was found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally.  at this point, mccall culdoplasty was performed with an #0 vicryl incorporating each uterosacral as well as the posterior peritoneum.  there did appear to be good support on palpation.  prior to this, the specimen was handed off and sent to pathology.  at this point, there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum.  hemostasis was obtained using a #0 vicryl in two single stitches.  good hemostasis was then obtained on the cuff as well as the pedicles.  copious irrigation was performed at this point with lactate ringers.  the round ligaments were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally.  again, copious amount of irrigation was performed and good hemostasis was obtained.  at this point, the peritoneum was reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspects to cover each pedicle bilaterally.  at this point, the bowel packing as well as moist ray-tech was removed and while re-approximating the bowel it was noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesions which were taken down using the metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel.  good hemostasis was obtained of these sites as well.  the sigmoid colon was then returned to its anatomic position and the omentum as well.  the rectus muscle was then reapproximated with two interrupted sutures of #2-0 vicryl.  the fascia was then reapproximated with #0 vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline.  the scarpa's fascia was then closed with #3-0 plain in a running suture.  the skin was then re-approximated with #4-0 undyed vicryl in a subcuticular closure.  this was dressed with an op-site.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  the sponge, lap, and needle were correct x2.  after the procedure, the patient was extubated and brought out of general anesthesia.  she will go to the floor where she will be followed postoperatively in the hospital.","obstetrics / gynecology,

cc.,history:  ,this is a 64-year-old female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in maryland in april of 2003 after having myocardial infarction.  she was then transferred to beaumont hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  the patient was treated for the abscess in beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in warren, michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,the patient subsequently recovered in a cardiac rehab facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of august, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an mri, which showed record signal change.  the patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  when she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  she was concerned and called the orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  i was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  on clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  the patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  long track signs are absent.  sensory level is at the c4 dermatome.  rectal tone is absent.  i discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  we discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  they are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,operative procedure:  ,the patient was taken to or #1 at abcd general hospital on a gurney.  department of anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  a foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  the patient was log rolled in a prone position on the jackson table.  bony prominences were well padded.  the patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  at this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the previous skin incision was reopened.  at this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  all sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  the self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  next, the epidural space was encountered.  there was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  a curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  the inferior edge of the c2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of t1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  the walls of the wound were explored.  there was no active bleeding.  retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  a #19 french hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  fascia was reapproximated with #1 vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 vicryl sutures.  steri-strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  the patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  she remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  once in the recovery room, she was alert.  she was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  prognosis for this patient is guarded.","surgery,
