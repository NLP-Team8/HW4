 trabeculectomy with mitomycin c - sample/template., Surgery, Trabeculectomy ,"preoperative diagnosis:, open angle glaucoma ox,postoperative diagnosis:, open angle glaucoma ox,procedure:, trabeculectomy with mitomycin c, xxx eye 0.3 c per mg times three minutes.,indications: ,this is a xx-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the ox eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.,procedure: ,the risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. informed consent was obtained. patient received several sets of drops in his/her xxx eye including ocuflox, ocular, and pilocarpine. (s)he was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the xxx eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% marcaine. the xxx eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. a lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. this was dissected posteriorly with vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with eraser-tip cautery. sponges soaked in mitomycin c 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. a super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. this was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. a temporal paracentesis was then made. scleral flap was lifted and a super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. a kelly-descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. dewecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. the iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. a scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. one end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. the other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. the anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. the anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 vicryl suture on a tg needle at each of the peritomy ends. then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. the conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using weck- cel sponge. the anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. at the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. speculum and drapes were carefully removed. ocuflox and maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. atropine was also placed over the eye. then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. the patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. there were no complications.","surgery, trabeculectomy, kelly-descemet punch, maxitrol ointment, open angle glaucoma, tg needle, bleeding, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, infection, iridectomy, loss of the eye, loss of vision, mitomycin c, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, temporal paracentesis, worsening of glaucoma, balanced salt solution, anterior chamber, scleral flap, eye, angle, mitomycin, conjunctival, chamber, flap, "

renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  after institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  the patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  sequential compression devices were also placed.  next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  a low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using co2 gas.  next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  the camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  the robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  at this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  these arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  the pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  a total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  at this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  the proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  we then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 monocryl sutures.  before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  this was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  this was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 monocryl sutures.  next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  next, gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  there was no obvious urine extravasation.  at this time, the procedure was terminated.  the robot was undocked.  under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  also, notably a jackson-pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,disposition: , the patient was discharged to post anesthesia care unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.","nephrology, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl

was placed supine on the operating table.  a foley catheter was inserted.  a formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site.  preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures.  the patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up.  the previous surgical incision was identified.  the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  the old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent.  immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue.  dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue.  soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring.  there was no native tissue to orient oneself with.  we carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer.  we incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter.  dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed.  this was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection.  the antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur.  dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum.  a cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure.  once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur.  this allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum.  the acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue.  this was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a bovie.  once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed.  reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell.  the 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit.  attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur.  the canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes.  some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal.  the length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place.  following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur.  this femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods.  the canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem.  the stem was selected and initially size a body was placed in trial.  the body was too tight proximally to fit.  the proximal canal was then reamed for a size aa body.  a longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size aa trial was assembled.  this fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill.  intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position.  intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur.  the remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed.  initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly.  we changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner.  again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly.  this was due to reversion of the femoral component.  as we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion.  the stem was extracted and retrialed.  improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components.  a 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell.  the real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal.  again, the hip was trialed.  the components were found to be in relative retroversion.  the real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted.  again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion.  along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts.  the femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated.  it was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing.  decision was made to accept the component position.  the real femoral head was selected and implanted.  the hip was then taken again to a range of motion.  it was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation.  the patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly.,the wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage.  six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure.,the wound was then closed in a layered fashion.  a hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 pds, 2-0 pds, and staples in the skin.  an incisional vac was then placed over the wound as well.  sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case.,disposition:,  the patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.","surgery, infected, bipolar arthroplasty, antibiotic spacer, revision, placement of antibiotic spacer, total hip arthroplasty, scar tissue, soft tissue,

non-st-elevation mi.,postoperative diagnosis and summary:,  the patient presented with an acute non-st-elevation mi.  despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  angiography demonstrated the severe lad as the culprit lesion.  this was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  she has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual lad lesions as noted above.  she will be continued on her medical therapy.  at age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,procedure performed: , selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,procedure in detail:,  after informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  the area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  using the percutaneous technique, a 6-french sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  with the guidewire in place, a 5-french jl-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  the catheter was removed.  the sheath flushed.  the 5-french 3drc catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  the cath removed, the sheath flushed.,it was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the lad, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-st elevation-mi.  the patient was given a bolus of heparin and an act of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the act was slightly lower.  we repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  we administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an act of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin iv.  additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of plavix orally during the procedure and integrilin iv bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,a 6-french cls 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and hew guidewire was positioned in the distal lad and another hew guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  an apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid lad stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  the balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  the balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  we attempted to advance a driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but i could not advance it beyond the proximal lad, where there was significant calcification.  the stent was removed.  attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  it was removed, a new apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal lad and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  one more attempt was made to advance the driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again i could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal lad and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  i felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  the guidewires and guide cath were removed.  the sheath flushed and sutured into position.  the patient moved to icu in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,contrast: , isovue-370, 120 ml.,fluoro time: , 9.4 minutes.,estimated blood loss: , 30 ml.,hemodynamics:,  aorta 185/54.,left ventriculography was not performed.  i did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,the left main is a large vessel, giving rise to lad and circumflex vessels.  the left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,the lad is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  the lad has significant calcification proximally.  there is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  this resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the lad just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  this was not ballooned.  beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  these 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  as noted above, this area was not stented because i could not safely advance the stent.  note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,the circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse

 total abdominal hysterectomy (tah) with a right salpingo-oophorectomy., Surgery, TAH & Salpingo-oophorectomy - 1 ,"preoperative diagnosis:  ,persistent abnormal uterine bleeding after endometrial ablation.,postoperative diagnosis: , persistent abnormal uterine bleeding after endometrial ablation.,procedure performed: , total abdominal hysterectomy (tah) with a right salpingo-oophorectomy.,complications: , none.,estimated blood loss: , 250 cc.,fluids:  ,1500 cc of crystalloids.,urine: , 125 cc of clear urine at the end of the procedure.,findings: , on exam, under anesthesia, an obese female with an enlarged fibroid uterus freely movable on the pelvis.  operative findings demonstrated the same with normal appearing tubes bilaterally.  the right ovary contained a right ovarian cyst.  the left ovary appeared to be within normal limits.  the peritoneal surfaces were noted to be within normal limits.  the bowel was also noted to be within normal limits.,indications for this procedure: , the patient is a 44-year-old female who had an endometrial ablation done in may, which showed submucosal fibroids.  she had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy.  she started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding.,she desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  the uterus, cervix, and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review.,procedure: , after informed consent was obtained, all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's term.  she was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  she was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above.  she was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  the pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia.  with the second knife, the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the mayo scissors.  the superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  the rectus muscle was then separated in the midline, the peritoneum was identified, entered bluntly and digitally.  then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder.  the gyn balfour was then placed.  a lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally, which were tented up with allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the #o-tie was passed through and then tied down.  then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  the round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament.  the right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a #0 vicryl in a heaney stitch fashion.  it was noted to be hemostatic.  attention was then turned to the left side, in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an #o-tie and then doubly clamped with straight ochsner clamps, transected and suture ligated with a #0 vicryl in a heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic.  the vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with allis clamps, and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a russian and metzenbaum scissors.  then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist ray-tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,the uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  in the similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament, the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated, and noted to be hemostatic.  the second lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix.  the cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable.  the cuff was then outlined.  the vaginal cuff was grasped with a ochsner clamp and then the cervix, uterus, and the right tube and ovary were transected using the jorgenson scissors.  the cuff outlined with ochsner clamps.  the cuff was then painted with a betadine soaked ray-tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina.  the vaginal cuff was then closed with a #0 vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles.  a long allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a #0 vicryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down.  at this time, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  the suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff, and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together.  then, the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the #0 vicryl that was used as a figure-of-eight stitch in the middle of the cuff.  the left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff.  the abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  the peritoneum was then re-peritonealized with a #3-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  the gyn balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen.  then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic.  the ______ was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum.  the omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a #3-0 vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with #0 vicryl in a running fashion.  the skin was closed with staples and dressing applied.  the patient was then examined at the end of the procedure.  the betadine-soaked sponge was removed from the vagina.  the cuff was noted to be intact without bleeding and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and she was taken to the recovery in stable condition.  the patient will be followed throughout her hospital stay.","surgery, tah, salpingo-oophorectomy, total abdominal

 radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection., Urology, Prostatectomy - Nerve Sparing ,"preoperative diagnosis:  ,prostate cancer.,postoperative diagnosis:,  prostate cancer.,operation performed:,  radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.,estimated blood loss: , 450 ml.,replacement:,  250 ml of cell saver and crystalloid.,complications: , none.,indications of surgery: , this is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate.  due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  infection.,2.  bleeding.,3.  incontinence.,4.  impotence.,5.  injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  deep venous thrombosis.,procedure in detail: , prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by dr. a without any difficulty.  the patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  a sterile 16-french foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  a midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  the rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the bovie.  transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  a bookwalter retractor was then placed.  the area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  given this patient's low gleason score and low psa with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the metzenbaum scissors.  opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  the dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  the deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using allis also and ligated by using 0 vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  with the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the bovie.  deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using metzenbaum scissors.  the urethra could then be easily identified.  nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using metzenbaum scissors.  this exposed the blue foley catheter.  anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 monocryl suture.  six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  the foley catheter was then removed.  this allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  this effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  the prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  the floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  the prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  the prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  the dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  the prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  the bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  this was developed without any difficulty.  both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  the seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  about two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  the tip was left behind.  using the bipolar gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  this was performed on the left side and then the right side.  this completely freed the prostate.  the prostate was sent for permanent section.  the opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 vicryl sutures.  the mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  the ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  the previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  this was performed by using a french ***** needle.  a 20-french foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  a 15 ml of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  the bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  a 19-french blake drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  all instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  the rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 pds.  subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 vicryl sutures.  the skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","urology,

turned 45 degrees to the patient's left and a small roll placed under her right shoulder and hip, the previously made pterional incision was reopened and extended along its posterior inferior limb to the patient's zygoma.  additional aspect of the temporalis muscle and fascia were incised with cutting bovie current with effort made to preserve the posterior limb of the external carotid artery.  the scalp and temporalis muscle were then retracted anteroinferiorly with 0 silk sutures, attached rubber bands and allis clamps and similar retraction of the posterior aspect of temporalis was retracted with 0 silk suture, attached with rubber bands and allis clamps.  the bone flap, which had not been fixed in place was removed.  an additional portion of the temporofrontal bone based at the zygoma was removed with a b1 dissecting tool, b1 attached to the midas rex instrumentation.  further bone removal was accomplished with leksell rongeur, and hemostasis controlled with the use of bone wax.,at this point, a retractor was placed along the frontal lobe for visualization of the perichiasmatic cistern with visualization made of the optic nerve and carotid artery.  it should be noted that cottonoid paddies were placed over the brain to protect the cortical surface of the brain both underneath the retractor and the remainder of the exposed cortex.  the sylvian fissure was then dissected with the dissection description being dictated by dr. x.,following successful splitting of the sylvian fissure to its apparent midplate, attention was next turned to the temporal tip where the approximate location of the cerebral aneurysm noted on ct angio, as well as conventional arteriography was noted and a peel incision was made extending from the temporal tip approximately 3 cm posterior.  this was enlarged with bipolar coagulation and aspiration and inferior dissection accomplished under the operating microscope until the dome of, what appeared to be, an aneurysm could be visualized.,dissection around the dome with bipolar coagulation and aspiration revealed a number of abnormal vessels, which appeared to be involved with the aneurysm at its base and these were removed with bipolar coagulation.  until circumferential dissection revealed 1 major arterial supply to the base of the aneurysm, this was felt to be able to be handled with bipolar coagulation, which was done and the vessel then cut with microscissors and the aneurysm removed in toto.,attention was next turned to the apparent nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, which was somewhat medial and inferior to the aneurysm and the nidus was then dissected with the use of bipolar coagulation and aspiration microscissors as further described by dr. x. with removal of the arteriovenous malformation, attention was then turned to the previous frontal cortical incision, which was the site of partial decompression of the patient's intracerebral hematoma on the day of her admission.  self-retaining retractors were placed within this cortical incision, and the hematoma cavity entered with additional hematoma removed with general aspiration and irrigation.  following removal of additional hematoma, the bed of the hematoma site was lined with surgicel.  irrigation revealed no further active bleeding, and it was felt that at this time both the arteriovenous malformation, associated aneurysm, and intracerebral hematoma had been sequentially dealt with.,the cortical surface was then covered with surgicel and the dura placed over the surface of the brain after coagulation of the dural edges, the freeze dried fascia, which had been used at the time of the 1st surgery was replaced over the surface of the brain with additional areas of cortical exposure covered with a duraguard.  the 2nd bone flap from the inferior frontotemporal region centered along the zygoma was reattached to the initial bone flap at 3 sites using a small 2-holed plate and 3-mm screws and the portable minidriver.,with this, return of the inferior plate accomplished, it was possible to reposition the bone flaps into their initial configuration, and attachments were secured anterior and posterior with somewhat longer 2-holed plates and 3-mm screws to the frontal and posterior temporal parietal region.  the wound was then closed.  it should be noted that a pledget of gelfoam had been placed over the entire dural complex prior to returning the bone flap.  the wound was then closed by approximating the temporalis muscle with 2-0 vicryl suture, the fascia was closed with 2-0 vicryl suture, and the galea was closed with 2-0 interrupted suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  the patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.","neurosurgery, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, pterional craniotomy, bone flap, bipolar coagulation, arteriovenous, pterional, malformation, hematoma, intracerebral,

16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,narrative: , informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  the patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  he was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  ekg leads were placed.  general anesthesia was induced.  the left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  a lid speculum was placed.  the posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  a large flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  the cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  the center of the cornea was marked.  the keratoprosthesis was identified.,a 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  this was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  the keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  this was done without difficulty.  at this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  at the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  the 9-0 prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  the keratoprosthesis was removed.  prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  the leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  these were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  the trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  the trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  these were tied securely into position with the iol nicely centered.  at this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  this was secured with four cardinal sutures.  the corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  the knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  the corneal graft was watertight.  attention was then turned back to the iol sutures, which were locked into position.  the ends were trimmed.  the flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  at this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  the patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  no complications were noted.  the attending surgeon, dr. x, performed the entire procedure.  no complications of the procedure were noted.  the intraocular lens was selected from

epidural.,estimated blood loss: , 450 ml.,complications: , none.,condition: , stable.,drains:  ,foley catheter.,indications: , the patient is a 39-year-old, g4, para 0-0-3-0, with an edc of 03/08/2009.  the patient began having prodromal symptoms 2 to 3 days prior to presentation.  she was seen on 03/09/2007 and a nonstress test was performed.  this revealed some spontaneous variable-appearing decelerations.  she was given iv hydration.  a biophysical profile was obtained, which provided a score of 0/8 with only a 1 cm fluid pocket found.  therefore, she was admitted for further fetal monitoring and evaluation.  she had changed her cervix from closed 2 days prior to presentation to 1 cm dilated.  she was having somewhat irregular contractions, but with stronger contractions, continued to have decelerations to 50 to 60 beats per minute.  due to these findings, a scalp electrode was placed as well as an iupc for an amnioinfusion.  this relieved the decelerations somewhat.  however, over a period of time with strong contractions, she still had bradycardia 40 to 50 beats per minute and developed a late component on the return of the decelerations.  due to this finding, it was evident that the fetal state would not support labor in order to accomplish a vaginal delivery.  these findings were reviewed with the patient and recommendation was made for cesarean section delivery.  the risks and benefits of this surgery were reviewed, and knowing these facts, the patient gave informed consent.,procedure: , the patient was taken to the operating room where her epidural anesthesia was reinforced.  she was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  after adequate epidural level was confirmed, the scalp was utilized to make a transverse incision in the patient's lower abdominal wall.  this incision was carried down to the level of the fascia, which was also transversely incised.  after adequate hemostasis, the fascia was bluntly and sharply separated up from the underlying rectus muscle.  the rectus muscle was separated in midline exposing the peritoneum.  the peritoneum was carefully grasped and elevated with hemostats.  it was entered in an up and down fashion with metzenbaum scissors.  the bladder blade was placed in the lower pole of the incision to protect the bladder.,the uterus was palpated and inspected.  a thin lower uterine segment was noted.  the vertex presentation was confirmed.  the scalp was then utilized to make a transverse or kerr incision in the lower uterine wall.  clear fluid was noted upon entering into the amniotic space.  at 05:27, a term viable female infant was delivered up through the incision.  she had spontaneous respirations.  she was given bulb suctioning for clear fluid.  her cord was clamped and cut and she was delivered off the field to dr. x who was attending.  the baby girl was subsequently signed apgars of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.  her birth weight was found to be 5 pounds and 5 ounces.,the placenta was manually extracted from the endometrial cavity.  a ring clamp and two allis clamps were placed around the margin of the uterine incision for hemostasis.  the uterus was delivered up into the operative field.  the endometrial cavity was swiped clean with a moist laparotomy pad.  the uterine incision was then closed in a two-layered fashion with 0 vicryl suture, the first layer interlocking and the second layer imbricating.  two additional stitches of 3-0 vicryl suture were utilized for hemostasis.  the uterine incision was noted to be hemostatic upon closure.  the uterus was rotated forward, normal tubes and ovaries were noted on both sides.  the uterus was then returned to its normal position of the abdominal cavity.  the sponge and instrument count was performed for the first time at this point and found to be correct.  the pelvis and anterior uterine space was then irrigated with saline solution.  it was suctioned dry.  a final check of the uterine incision confirmed hemostasis.  the rectus muscle was stabilized across the midline with two simple stitches of 0 vicryl suture.  the subcutaneous tissue was then exposed, and the fascia closed with two running lengths of 0 vicryl suture, beginning in lateral margins and overlapping the midline.  the subcutaneous tissue was then irrigated and inspected.  no active bleeding was noted.  it was closed with a running length of 3-0 plain catgut suture.  the skin was then approximated with surgical steel staples.  the incision was infiltrated with a 0.5% solution of marcaine local anesthetic.  the incision was cleansed and sterilely dressed.,the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  the estimated blood loss through the procedure was 450 ml.  the sponge and instrument counts were performed two more times during closure and found to be correct each time.","surgery, low-transverse incision, edc,

none.,pathology: , the right tube and ovary sent to pathology for review.,findings: , on exam under anesthesia, a normal-appearing vulva and vagina and normally palpated cervix, a uterus that was normal size, and a large right adnexal mass.  laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  there was no noted blood in the pelvis.,indications for this procedure:,  the patient is a 26-year-old g1 p1 who presented to abcd general emergency room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  the pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the emergency room.  the patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  there was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  there was no fevers or chills.  her cultures done in the emergency room were pending.  the patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  the uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  there was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.,procedure:,  after informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  she was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  her bladder was drained with a red robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  a weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  the cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  the uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  the vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  the weighted speculum was removed.  attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  the veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  the co2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  this was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  a suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a ligasure vessel sealing system.  the right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  the endocatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  the ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.,there was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  this was a clear yellow fluid.  then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  the suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  the trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the nezhat-dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  the pelvis was clear and clean.  ,pictures were obtained.  the suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and ur6.  two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  therefore, the camera was removed.  all instruments were removed.  the abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  the infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-vicryl and ur6.  the right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.  the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  dressings were changed.  the weighted speculum was removed from the patient's cervix.  the cervix noted to be hemostatic.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and the patient was taken to the recovery in stable condition.",

excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture.  after the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with k-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit.  the screws were then placed.  these were 12 mm screws.  they were placed 4 in number.  the k-wires were then removed.  finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist.  this was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure.  it was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation.  the motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed.  the nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm.  in this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon.  incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline.  homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery.  the pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion.  a large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position.  the tourniquet was let down.  the fingers were immediately pink.  the patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  there were no operative complications.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.","orthopedic, intraarticular fracture, esmarch, k-wires, open reduction and internal fixation, tourniquet, carpal tunnel release, carpal tunnel syndrome, flexor carpi radialis, flexor pronator muscles, intraarticular, right distal radius, transverse carpal ligament, volar flexion crease, pronator quadratus, flexor carpi, carpi radialis, flexion crease, carpal ligament, carpal tunnel, carpal, volar"

the patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember.  she does have a history of charcot-marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time.,procedure: , an iv was instituted by the department of anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  the patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  copious amounts of webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  after adequate sedation by the department of anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% marcaine plain were injected in a mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  the foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  the foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an esmarch bandage.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmhg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  the stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,the incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  all vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  the capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  at this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  there was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  the abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  the lateral capsulotomy was performed.  the extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,at this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  the capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  the first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  a 0.45 k-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  this k-wire was used as an access guide for a juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  the sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  the osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  the cortical hinge was maintained.  a 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard ao fashion.  at this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  a second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard ao fashion with compression noted.  the ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  the 0.45 k-wire was removed.  the foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  at this time, it was incised to perform an akin osteotomy.,original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  the incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  the capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  an akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  after where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  at 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  the #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  the remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  the area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  the area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  capsule was closed with #3-0 vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  a running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  steri-strips were applied.  total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  dressings consisted of owen silk, 4x4s, kling, kerlix.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,the patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  the patient was transferred back to the pacu with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  the patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot.  the patient was given postop pain

infection requiring first ray resection.", Surgery, Gangrene Surgery ,"preoperative diagnosis: , gangrene osteomyelitis, right second toe.,postoperative diagnosis: , gangrene osteomyelitis, right second toe.,operative report:  ,the patient is a 58-year-old female with poorly controlled diabetes with severe lower extremity lymphedema.  the patient has history of previous right foot infection requiring first ray resection.  the patient has ulcerations of right second toe dorsally at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which has failed to respond to conservative treatment.  the patient now has exposed bone and osteomyelitis in the second toe.  the patient has been on iv antibiotics as an outpatient and has failed to respond to these and presents today for surgical intervention.,after an iv was started by the department of anesthesia, the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  a restraint belt was placed around the patient's waist using copious amounts of webril and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the patient's right ankle and the patient was made comfortable by the department of anesthesia.  after adequate amounts of sedation had been given to the patient, we administered a block of 10 cc of 0.5% marcaine plain in proximal digital block around the second digit.  the foot and ankle were then prepped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  the foot was elevated and an esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  the tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmhg and the foot was brought back onto the table.  using band-aid scissors, the stockinet was cut and reflected and using a wet and dry sponge, the foot was wiped, cleaned, and the second toe identified.,using a skin scrape, a racket type incision was planned around the second toe to allow also remodelling of previous operative site.  using a fresh #10 blade, skin incision was made circumferentially in the racket-shaped manner around the second digit.  then, using a fresh #15 blade, the incision was deepened and was taken down to the level of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.  care was taken to identify bleeders and cautery was used as necessary for hemostasis.  after cleaning up all the soft tissue attachments, the second digit was disarticulated down to the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint.  the head of the second metatarsal was inspected and was noted to have good glistening white cartilage with no areas of erosion evident by visual examination.  attention was then directed to closure of the wound.  all remaining tissue was noted to be healthy and granular in appearance with no necrotic tissue evident.  areas of subcutaneous tissue were then removed through a sharp dissection in order to allow better approximation of the skin edges.  due to long-standing lower extremity lymphedema and postoperative changes on previous surgery, i thought that we were unable to close the incision in entirety.  therefore, after copious amounts of irrigation using sterile saline, it was determined to use modified dental rolls using #4-0 gauze to remove tension from the skin.  deep vertical mattress sutures were used in order to reapproximate more closely, the skin edges and bring the plantar flap of skin up to the dorsal skin.  this was obtained using #2-0 nylon suture.  following this, the remaining exposed tissue from the wound was covered using moist to dry saline soaked 4 x 4 gauze.  the wound was then dressed using 4 x 4 gauze fluffed with abdominal pads, then using kling and kerlix and an ace bandage to provide compression.  the tourniquet was deflated at 42 minutes' time and hemostasis was noted to be achieved.  the ace bandage was extended up to just below the knee and no bleeding striking to the bandages was appreciated.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was escorted to the postanesthesia care unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact, as was evidenced by capillary bleeding, which was present during the procedure.  sedation was given postoperative introductions, which include to remain nonweightbearing to her right foot.  the patient was instructed to keep the foot elevated and to apply ice behind her knee as necessary, no more than 20 minutes each hour.  the patient was instructed to continue her regular medications.  the patient was to continue iv antibiotic course and was given prescription for vicoprofen to be taken q.4h. p.r.n. for moderate to severe pain #30.  the patient will followup with podiatry on monday morning at 8:30 in the podiatry clinic for dressing change and evaluation of her foot at that time.,the patient was instructed as to signs and symptoms of infection, was instructed to return to the emergency department immediately if these should present.  the second digit was sent to pathology for gross and micro.","surgery, dorsally, toe, ulcerations, foot infection, ray

l5-s1.,history: , this is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the s1 nerve root distribution.  the patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  he denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the s1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  after an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,procedure detail:  ,he was wheeled back to operating room #5 at abcd general hospital on 08/28/03.  after a general anesthetic was administered, a foley catheter was inserted.,the patient was then turned prone on the jackson table.  all of his bony prominences were well-padded.  at this time, a myelogram was then performed.  after the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  the needle was localized to the level of l3-l4 region.  once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  at this time, approximately 10 cc of conray injected into the thecal sac.  the patient was then placed in the reversed trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  the myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of l5-s1 on the left.  there was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the ap and the lateral projections using c-arm fluoroscopy.  at this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  a long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  the surgery was going to be on the left.  once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the l5-s1 nerve root region.  at this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  at this time, a weitlaner was inserted.  bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  we further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  a cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  at this time, a taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  suction as well as bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  at this time, a small kerrison rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the s1 nerve root, which was compressive.  we removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the s1 nerve root.  a nerve root retractor was then placed.  identification of disc space was then performed.  a #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  a small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  the part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,at this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  we then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  at this time, a small piece of gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  we did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  sterile dressings were then applied.  the patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  at this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.","neurosurgery, microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy, discectomy,

 penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration., Urology, Penile Injury ,"reason for admission:,  penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration.,history of present illness:,  the patient is an 18-year-old detainee who was brought by police officers because of a penile injury and bleeding.  he is otherwise healthy.  he tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago.  he told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble.  then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there.  he was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has.  then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out.  he was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs.  so, he was brought to the hospital.  actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked with blood.  he came here and was continuously bleeding from that area that we had to change the dressing twice and he is actually still bleeding especially from one of the laceration, the one on the right side of the penis.  the marble also still can be felt underneath the skin.  there is no urethral bleeding.  he did urinate today without difficulty, without hematuria or dysuria.  there is pain

slightly enlarged, anteverted, freely mobile uterus with an enlarged left adnexa.  laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,no adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  there was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  there were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,procedure:  ,the patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  she was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  the uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  the cervix was then serially dilated with hank dilators to a size #20 hank.  next a telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  at this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  the superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and veress needle was inserted through this incision.  small amount of normal saline was injected into veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  so, the veress needle was connected to he co2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  it was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  the abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  next, the veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the co2 gas.  at this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  this was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a veress needle with ethicon sheet, and the veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  a size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  a blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  these were used to see the above operative findings.  next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  through this, a harmonic scalpel was inserted.,the harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  the fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  after the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  the adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the harmonic scalpel.  at intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  at this point, the harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  this was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  first the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  this was grasped with a clamp.  the ligature device was removed from the #12 and a endocatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  the left ovary was placed in this endocatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  at this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  the camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  the #11 port was removed.  next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted

ligament.,anesthesia: , spinal.,tourniquet time: , 90 min.,blood loss:,  50 cc.,the patient is in the semilateral position on the beanbag.,intraoperative findings:,  a comminuted hawkins iv talus fracture with an incomplete rupture of the deltoid ligament.  there was no evidence of osteochondral defects of the talar dome.,history:  ,this is a 50-year-old male who presented to abcd general hospital emergency department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  there was no open injury.  the patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  there was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  an x-ray was performed in the emergency room, which revealed a grade iv hawkins classification talus fracture.  he was distal neurovascularly intact.  the patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle.,it was for this reason, we elected to undergo the above-named procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  the patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  all risks as well as complications were discussed.,procedure: , the patient was brought back to operative room #4 of abcd general hospital on 08/20/03.  a spinal anesthetic was administered.  a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  he was then positioned on the beanbag.  the extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  an esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmhg.  at this time, an anteromedial incision was made in order to perform a medial malleolus osteotomy to best localize the fracture region in order to be able to bone graft the comminuted fracture site.  at this time, a #15 blade was used to make approximately 10 cm incision over the medial malleolus.  this was curved anteromedial along the root of the saphenous vein.  the saphenous vein was located.  its tributaries going plantar were cauterized and the vein was retracted anterolaterally.  at this time, we identified the medial malleolus.  there was evidence of approximately 80% avulsion, rupture of the deltoid ligament off of the medial malleolus.  this was a major blood feeder to the medial malleolus and we were concerned, once we were going to do the osteotomy, that this would later create healing problem.  it is for this reason that the pedicle, which was attached to the medial malleolus, was left intact.  this pedicle was the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament.  at this time, a microchoice saw was then used to make a box osteotomy of the medial malleolus.  once this was performed, the medial malleolus was retracted anterolaterally with its remaining pedicle intact for later blood supply.  this provided us with excellent exposure to the fracture site of the medial side.  at this time, any loose comminuted pieces were removed.  the dome of the talus was also checked and did not reveal any osteochondral defects.  there was some comminution on the dorsal aspect of the complete talus fracture and we were concerned that once we place the screw, this would tend to extend the fracture site.  it is for this reason, we did the medial malleolar osteotomy to prevent this from happening in order to best expose the fracture site.  at this time, a reduction was performed.  the #7-0 partially threaded cannulated screws were used in order to fix the fracture.  at this time, a 3.2 mm guidewire was placed going from posterolateral to anteromedial.,this was placed slightly lateral to the achilles tendon, percutaneously inserted, and then drilled in the according fashion across the fracture site.  once this was performed, a skin knife was then used to incise over the percutaneous insertion in order to accommodate the screw going in.  a depth gauze was then used to measure screw length.  a cannulated drill was then used to drill across the fracture site to allow the entrance of the screw.  a 55 mm partially threaded #7-0 cannulated screw was then placed with excellent compression at the fracture site.  once this was obtained, we checked the reduction again using intraoperative xi-scan in the ap and lateral direction.  this projection gave us excellent view of our screw placement and excellent compression across the fracture site.  at this time, we bone grafted the area of comminution using 1 cc of dynagraft with crushed cancellous allograft.  this was placed using a freer elevator into the fracture site where the comminution was.  at this time, we copiously irrigated the wound.  the osteotomy site was then repaired, first clamped using two large tenaculum reduction clamps.  two partially threaded #4-0 cannulated screws were then used to fix the osteotomy site and anatomical reduction was performed with excellent compression across the osteotomy site with the two screws.  next, a #1-0 vicryl was then used to repair the deltoid ligament, which was ruptured via the injury.  a tight repair was performed of the deltoid ligament.  at this time, again copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  a #2-0 vicryl was then used to approximate the subcutaneous skin and staples for the skin incision.  at this time, the leg was cleansed, adaptic, 4 x 4, and kerlix roll were then applied.  the patient was then placed in a plaster splint for mobilization.  the tourniquet was then released.  the patient was then transferred off the operating table to recovery in stable condition.  the prognosis for this fracture is guarded.  there is a high rate of avascular necrosis of the talar body, approximately anywhere from 40-60% risk.  the patient is aware of this and he will be followed as an outpatient for this problem.","orthopedic, deltoid ligament, medial malleolus osteotomy, open reduction internal

operation: , salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal with epidural.,indications:  ,this patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy.  he was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising psa.  after that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  one year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  he had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  there were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  he wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  i took him to the operating room on january 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  we both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  i felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,findings: , at exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  the bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  the opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  a nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  he was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  a generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  moist wound towels and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  we began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  the ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  an identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,we began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  this was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  we then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  there was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  we then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,we then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch.  i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  the colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia-80 stapler.  i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  the mesentery was then sealed with a ligasure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a gia-60 stapler.  we then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a gia-80 stapler, closing the open end with a ta 60.  the angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-french robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the gia-60 stapler.  the ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-french robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,as the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 vicryl sutures.  the bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the sgia polysorb-75.  between the staple lines, vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 vicryl suture ligatures.,we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  the left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a cook 8.4-french ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  the right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  we then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  a 24-french malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  the staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture.  the pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,we then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  the cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  a portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  we left an 18-french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  the malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,we matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  the stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower quadrant.  a large jp drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the indiana pouch.,the rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  the estimated blood loss was 450 ml, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  the final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  the patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","urology, radiation cystitis, voiding dysfunction, retropubic prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy, salvage cystectomy, indiana pouch continent cutaneous

auto versus a tree accident on 6/15/2009.  the patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  the patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  she underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the medicine service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  the patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  all questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  the risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,findings:,1.  there was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  the base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  as the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,operative report in detail:  ,the patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  the left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  she was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  she received ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  a time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  when all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  at this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  a single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  when this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  x-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  at this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  the stab wounds for the schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,plan:  ,the patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  she will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture.","surgery, phalanx fracture, schantz pins, toe fracture, tibia fracture,

very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  she appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,description of procedure: , the patient was taken to the angio suite, placed in a supine position.  after adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with chloraseptic prep.  cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-french sheath.  through the 4-french sheath a 4-french omni flush catheter was placed.  the glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,the catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  a timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, i opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  the catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, i obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  the omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  the glidewire rather exchanged for an amplatz stiff wire.  this was left in place and the 4-french sheath removed and replaced with a 6-french destination 45-cm sheath.  this was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  i identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,the patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  a glidewire was carefully advanced using roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  a 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  a search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  for this reason, i used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  no significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  for this reason, i chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,i then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-french angio-seal device.  attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-french sheath.  this was immediately exchanged for the 6-french destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  the glidewire was exchanged for the amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  the destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  for this reason, i performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  a minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  no further significant abnormality was identified.  to avoid placing a stent in the small vessel i left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  a 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  however, due to her propensity for dissection i opted not to.  i then exchanged the glidewire for an o1 for thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  this was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  a 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  i then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  the destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an angio-seal deployed.,findings: , aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  no evidence of renal artery stenosis

models were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact regions for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region was scrubbed per routine.  surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient was draped.  xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml was infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  a primary incision was made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  release incisions were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,a full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  the contents of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramina were identified.  the hard palate was directly observed.  the facial tissues were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  similar features were reflected on the contralateral side.  the area was re-contoured with rongeurs.  the block of bone, which was formed and harvested from the left ilium was then placed and found to be stable.  a surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  a series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screws measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  particulate bone was then placed around the remaining block of bone.  a piece of alloderm mixed with croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which was centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood was then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  the tissues were expanded then with a tissue metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue was expanded, the tissues were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous sutures #3-0 gore-tex.  attention was brought then to the mandible.  1% xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were

degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  the anterior body was found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  a posterior tunnel was done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge was then degloved.  a tunnel was formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  a similar procedure was done on the contralateral side.  the tissues were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation was used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur was used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.  a block of bone was inserted between the mental foramina and fixative with three 16 cm screws first with a twist drill then followed with self-tapping 2 mm diameter titanium screws.  the block of bone was further re-contoured in situ.  particulate bone was then injected into the posterior tunnels bilaterally.  a piece of alloderm was placed over those particulate segments.  the tissues were approximated for primary closure using #3-0 gore-tex suture both interrupted and horizontal mattress in form.  the tissues were compressed for about four minutes to allow platelet clots to form and to help adhere the

endotracheal.,estimated blood loss:,  100 ml.,fluids: , crystalloid.,the patient was bowel prepped and was given preoperative antibiotics.,brief history: , the patient is a 73-year-old male, who presented to us with a referral from dr. x's office with bilateral renal mass and renal insufficiency.  the patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7.  the patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass.  since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time.  the patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  the patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.,risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed.  the patient understood the risk of delayed bleeding, the needing for nephrectomy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, etc., and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,details of the or:  ,the patient was brought to the or.  anesthesia was applied.  the patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  the patient was bowel prepped.  the patient was placed in right side up, left side down, semiflank, with kidney rest up.  all the pressure points are very well padded using foam and towels.  the left knee was bent and the right knee was straight.  there was no tension on any of the joints.  all pressure points were well padded.  the patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape all the way around.  a foley catheter and og tube were in place prior to prepping and draping the patient.  a periumbilical incision measuring about 6 cm was made.  the incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection.  the peritoneum was open.  abdomen was entered.  there were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz.  two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line.  a gel porter was placed.  pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  all ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially.  duodenum was cauterized.  minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around.  pictures were taken.  superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes.  the 2 lesions were frozen.  the 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter.  so the r3.8 and r2.4 long probes were used.  freezing/thawing, two cycles were done.  the temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done.  the exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart.  there was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign.  the probes were removed.,the probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.,after freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with surgicel were placed.  pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding.  from the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes.  so the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum.  pneumoperitoneum was obtained again.  fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure.  there was about a total of 100 ml of blood loss overall with the entire procedure.  please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ.  the kidney was kept in the left hand at all times.  careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen.  the laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions.  at the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, surgicel, and endoseal, the colon was reflected medially.  please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel.  lap count was correct.  please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions.  no deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding.  the 12-mm ports were closed using 0-vicryl and the middle incision.  the hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 pds from both sides and was tied in the middle.  please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-vicryl in running fashion.  after closing the abdomen, 4-0 monocryl was used to close the skin and dermabond was applied.,the patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.","surgery, hand-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation,

general endotracheal.,procedure detail: , after identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  after establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  the eyes were then tacked with tegaderm.  the nerve integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  a 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  shoulder roll was applied.  the patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  a 15-blade was used to make the incision.  subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  as we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  the sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  similar procedure was performed on the right side.,attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  again this was very firm in nature.  the superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  the inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  this had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  this was followed superiorly.  the level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  a prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,attention was then turned to the right side.  there was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  multiple nodules were appreciated.  in a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  the superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  the superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  the anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  a small amount of tissue was left at the berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  the entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  the wound was copiously irrigated, valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  the parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the nerve integrity monitoring system.,attention was then turned to burying the surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  the strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  the 1/8th inch hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  the incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl and indermil for the skin.  the patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  the patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility.","surgery, total thyroidectomy, goiter, multinodular thyroid goiter, multinodular,

 ,the patient had a lumbar subarachnoid drain placed yesterday.  all went well with the surgery.  the catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and ct scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  the patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,description of procedure:  ,after induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  there was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  the arms were not hyperextended.  great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  a foley catheter was in place.  she received iv cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  it was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the l4 or l3 interspinous space.,the patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,a 7-cm incision was made over the l1 lamina.  the incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  a self-retaining mccullough retractor was placed.  the laminae were quite deep.  the microscope was brought in and using the midas rex drill with the am-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of l1-l2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  the opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  at first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and i then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  the upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  the fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,i persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and i was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,the wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,at this point, i then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the l4 interspinous space and then later in the l3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the tuohy needle.  dr. y also tried.  despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  it will be done at a later date.,i felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  the potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and i just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 pds interrupted sutures.,after the dura was closed, a piece of gelfoam was placed over the dura.  the paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 vicryl interrupted sutures.  the subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 vicryl interrupted suture.  the subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 vicryl rapide.  the 4-0 vicryl rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,the patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  the patient tolerated procedure well.  no complications.  sponge and needle counts correct.  blood loss minimal, none replaced.  this procedure took 5 hours.  this case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina.","surgery, laminotomy, microdissection, lumbar spinal catheter, external lumbar drain,

for hemofiltration via the left common femoral vein.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal.,operative procedure: , with the patient in the supine position, he was prepped from shin to knees and draped in a sterile field.  a right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  a sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle.  the patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava.  a percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava.  after satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium.  after the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place.  a cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium.  the wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the swan-ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field.  cardiectomy was then performed, first resecting the anterior portion of the right atrium and then transecting the aorta, the pulmonary artery, the septum between the right and left atriums, and then the heart was removed.  the right and left atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were prepared for the transplant.  first, we did a side-to-side anastomosis, continued to the left atrium and this was performed using 3-0 prolene suture and a right atrial anastomosis side-to-side was performed using 3-0 prolene suture.  the pulmonary artery was then anastomosed using 5-0 prolene and the aorta was anastomosed with 4-0 prolene.  the arterial anastomosis in the pulmonary artery and aorta were not completed until the heart was filled with blood.  air was evacuated and the sutures were tied down.  the clamp on the ascending aorta was removed and the patient was gradually overtime weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  the patient had a postoperative coagulopathy which prolonged the period of time in the operating room after completion and weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass.  blood factors and factor vii were given to try and correct the coagulopathy.  because of excessive transfusions that were required, a mahurkar catheter was inserted through the left common femoral vein, first placing a needle into the vein and then guidewire removed, and the needle dilators were then placed and then the mahurkar catheter was then placed with 2-0 nylon suture.  hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time.  after he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound.  the patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively.  this was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy.  the patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor vii.  urine output for the procedure was 520 ml.  the preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet.  the estimated blood loss was at least 6 l.  the patient was taken to the intensive care unit in guarded condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, cardiomyopathy, ioban, ischemic, ischemic cardiomyopathy, mahurkar

time was ** minutes.  cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,procedure in detail: , after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  a #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using bovie electrocautery.  the sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  next, the chest retractor was positioned.  the pericardium was opened with bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  we then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  a 2-0 ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  through this was passed our sec cannula.  this was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a y-shaped circuit.  next, a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  this was likewise connected to the y connection of our venous cannula portion.  we then used a 4-0 u-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the svc and ivc, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  sondergaard's groove was taken down.  next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  this was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  the left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  of note was the fact that the mitral valve p2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  the borders of the p2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  after doing so, the p2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 ethibond pledgeted suture.  this was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  the pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  next, the more anterior portion of the p2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  this was done without difficulty.  the apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  there was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  it was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  next, 2-0 non-pledgeted ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the cosgrove-galloway suture band ring from medtronic.  after, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the cg suture band.  the suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  we then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  we subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  we closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 prolene in a running fashion.  this was done without difficulty.  we de-aired the heart.  we then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  the aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  we then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 prolene.  we placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  the patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  we then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  this site was buttressed with a 4-0 prolene on an sh needle.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  we placed a mediastinal #32-french chest tube as well as a right chest blake drain.  the mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  there were none.  we closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the fascia was closed with a #1 vicryl followed by a 2-0 vicryl, followed by 3-0 vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good

the usual sterile manner with betadine solution.  a longitudinal incision was made after a betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  the common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  the abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  mild adhesions were lysed.  the omentum was freed.  the small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities.  the liver and gallbladder were within normal limits.  no abnormalities were noted.  at this point, the bookwalter retractor was placed.  ng tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction.  the intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally.  the rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  the aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  the left iliac was completely occluded.  the right iliac was to be cleansed.  at this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  the aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  a single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 prolene.  the inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  care was taken to preserve collaterals.  the aorta was measured, and a 16 mm gore-tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 prolene in a running fashion.  last stitch was tied.  hemostasis was excellent.  the clamp was gradually removed and additional prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  at this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  the limbs were vented and irrigated.  using bimanual technique, the

segmental lower extremity run off.,anesthesia: , conscious sedation.,indication for procedure:  ,the patient presents with lower extremity claudication.  she is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  she appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,description of procedure: , the patient was taken to the angio suite, placed in a supine position.  after adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with chloraseptic prep.  cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-french sheath.  through the 4-french sheath a 4-french omni flush catheter was placed.  the glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,the catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  a timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, i opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  the catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, i obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  the omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  the glidewire rather exchanged for an amplatz stiff wire.  this was left in place and the 4-french sheath removed and replaced with a 6-french destination 45-cm sheath.  this was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  i identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,the patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  a glidewire was carefully advanced using roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  a 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  a search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  for this reason, i used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  no significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  for this reason, i chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,i then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-french angio-seal device.  attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-french sheath.  this was immediately exchanged for the 6-french destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  the glidewire was exchanged for the amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  the destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  for this reason, i performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  a minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  no further significant abnormality was identified.  to avoid placing a stent in the small vessel i left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  a 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  however, due to her propensity for dissection i opted not to.  i then exchanged the glidewire for an o1 for thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  this was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  a 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  i then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  the destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an angio-seal deployed.,findings: , aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  no evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  there is a single left renal artery.  the infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  on the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal

, the patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  he was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  they wished to proceed.,procedure:,  the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  general anesthesia was induced without incident.  he was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  appropriate lines were then placed.  he had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,he was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  an oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  the rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  the rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,the underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  this allowed for entry into the pleural space.  the lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  the diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  this required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  these were performed from t11-l3.  this was over 5 levels.  disks and endplates were then removed.  once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  the table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  this was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,the diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  the ribs were held together with #1 vicryl sutures.  muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 pds sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 pds suture as well.  skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 monocryl.  this was dressed with xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,the patient was then rotated into a prone position.  the spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,longitudinal incision was made from t2-l5.  the underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  the spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  this allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  once this was completed, the c-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  these were placed at l4 and l5.  the interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  this was done using a rongeur as well as a kerrison rongeur.  spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,once all the interspaces were prepared, songer wires were then passed.  these were placed from l3-t3.,once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  this was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  the wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where i was operating and then on the right side spine.  this allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  this was done using pulsed lavage.,the wound was then closed in layers.  the deep fascia was closed using running #1 pds suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 pds suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 monocryl as needed.  the wound was then dressed with steri-strips, xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  the patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  all instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.,the patient will be managed in the icu and then on the floor as indicated.","neurosurgery, anterior spine fusion, posterior spine fusion, spine segmental instrumentation, dry sterile

bilaterally.,specimens:  ,uterine fragments.,complications:,  none.,procedure in detail: , the patient was brought to the or where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained without difficulty.  the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  examination under anesthesia revealed an anteverted uterus and no adnexal masses.  the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  a foley catheter was placed in the patient's bladder.  the patient's cervix was visualized with speculum.  a single-tooth tenaculum was placed on the anterior lip of the cervix.  a humi uterine manipulator was placed through the internal os of the cervix and the balloon was inflated.  the tenaculum and speculum were then removed from the vagina.  attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a small infraumbilical incision was made with scalpel.  veress needle was placed through this incision and the patient's abdomen was inflated to a pressure of 15 mmhg.  veress needle was removed and then 5-mm trocar was placed through the umbilical incision.  laparoscope was placed through this incision and the patient's abdominal contents were visualized.  a 2nd trocar incision was placed in the midline 2 cm above the symphysis pubis and a 5-mm trocar was placed through this incision on direct visualization for laparoscope.  a trocar incision was made in the right lower quadrant.  a 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  a ___ trocar incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a 2nd 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  the patient's abdominal and pelvic anatomy were again visualized with the assistance of a blunt probe.  the gyrus cautery was used to cauterize and cut the right and left round ligaments.  the anterior leaf of the broad ligament was bluntly dissected and cauterized and cut in an inferior fashion towards lower uterine segment.  the right uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut using the gyrus.  the uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  the gyrus was then used to cauterize the right uterine vessels.  gyrus was then used on the left side to cauterize and cut the left round ligament.  the anterior leaf of the broad ligament on the left side was bluntly dissected, cauterized, and cut.  using the gyrus, the left uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut and the left uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  the left uterine vessels were then cauterized and cut using the gyrus.  at this point, as the uterine vessels had been cauterized on both sides, the uterine body exhibited blanching.  at this point, the harmonic scalpel hook was used to amputate the uterine body from the cervix at the level just below the uterine vessels.  the humi manipulator was removed prior to amputation of the uterine body.  after the uterine body was detached from the cervical stump, morcellation of the uterine body was performed using the uterine morcellator.  the uterus was removed in a piecemeal fashion through the right lower quadrant trocar incision.  once, all fragments of the uterus were removed from the abdominal cavity, the pelvis was irrigated.  the harmonic scalpel was used to cauterize the remaining endocervical canal.  the cervical stump was also cauterized with the harmonic scalpel and good hemostasis was noted at the cervical stump and also at the sites of all pedicles.  the harmonic scalpel was then used to incise the right ovarian simple cyst.  the right ovarian cyst was then drained yielding straw-colored fluid.  the site of right ovarian cystotomy was noted to be hemostatic.  the pelvis was again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  the ureters were identified on both sides and noted to be intact throughout the visualized course.  all instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was deflated.  the fascial defects at the 10-mm trocar sites were closed using figure-of-8 sutures of 0-vicryl and skin incisions were closed with a 4-0 vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  the cervix was then visualized with the speculum.  good hemostasis at the site of tenaculum insertion was obtained using silver nitrate sticks.  all instruments were removed from the patient's vagina and the patient was placed in normal supine position.,sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x2.  the patient was awoken from anesthesia and then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","obstetrics / gynecology,

66-year-old caucasian female who presented to abcd general hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.  the patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  she had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  she was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  the patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  she was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,operative procedure:  ,the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  the patient received preoperative antibiotics with kefzol.  the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with betadine solution.  the patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  utilizing a veress needle, the veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the co2 insufflation.  the abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmhg.  after adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  a subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  all ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  after all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  adhesions adjacent were taken down with a maryland dissector.  once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  this helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  utilizing maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  utilizing endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  the gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  no evidence of stones were visualized.  once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an endocatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into endocatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  this was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  a small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  this was also taken and sent off as specimen.  the abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  all laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.  the abdomen was de-insufflated.  utilizing #0 vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.  all incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed vicryl.  two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures.  the areas were cleaned and dried.  steri-strips were placed.  on the incisions, sterile dressing was applied.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  she was extubated following procedure.  she is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with dr. x within one week for a follow-up

however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  the redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  it was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  the brainstem was identified above the complex.  similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  there were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  the lateral pontine vein was maintained.  microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  a number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  this then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  a number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  the nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  the tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  the cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  the tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  at this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  there was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  all the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  dr. x then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,i then scrubbed back into case once dr. x had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  there was no tumor remaining at this point.  i placed some norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  an intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  there was no bleeding.  the nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  the dura was then closed with 4-0 nurolons in interrupted fashion.  a muscle plug was used over one area.  duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by hemaseel.  gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  the wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  o vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,the patient was extubated and taken to the icu in stable condition.","surgery, suboccipital, craniectomy, microscope, cranioplasty, acoustic neuroma, cerebellar peduncle, nerve complex, brainstem, nurolon, cavitron, kerrison, leksell, lateral pontine vein, suboccipital craniectomy, nerve, tumor"

artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. the patient presented with what appeared to be a copd exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-st elevation myocardial infarction. he was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.,description of procedure:, after informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. the patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. then, a 6-french sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-french jl4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-french jr4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-french angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. at the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. then, a perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,hemodynamic data:, the opening aortic pressure was 91/63. the left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. the patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,coronary angiogram:, the left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. the lad had mild diffuse disease. there appeared to be distal tapering of the lad. the left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. in the very distal aspect of the circumflex after om-3 and om-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. the runoff from this area appeared to be a very small plom type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. the right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. the plv branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. the pda at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. the pda was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. the right coronary is dominant.,conclusion:, mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. this circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. there is a 100% plv branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. there is an ostial 80% right pda lesion. the plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right pda.,the case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right pda. a 6-french jr4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. the lesion was crossed with a long bmw 0.014 guidewire. then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm maverick balloon.

some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  there was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  his speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  his attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  there was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  his affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  at times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  there was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  there was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  mr. t presented with

 his credibility seemed good.  there was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  the reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  the information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  his attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  there was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,impressions: , major depressive disorder, single episode,recommendations and plan: , i recommend mr. t continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  at this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede mr. t from seeking employment.  furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on march 25, 2003, when mr. t was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  as mr. t placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive

of procedure: , after obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  the right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  using modified seldinger technique, a 7-french sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-french sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  thereafter, 6-french pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  thereafter, a 4-french sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified seldinger technique.  thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch j-wire into the left ventricle and lv-gram was performed in rao view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the lao view.  therefore, a 6-french jl4 and jr4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,angiographic findings:  ,1.  lv-gram:  lvedp was 15 mmhg.  lv ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  only anterior

regurgitation.,2.  the right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  the left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  the left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  first diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  the circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,intervention: , after reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  the 4-french sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-french impella sheath through which an amplatz wire and a 6-french multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  the amplatz wire was exchanged for an impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  the multipurpose catheter was removed, and the impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  thereafter, a 7-french jl4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  the diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-lad and a 3.0 x 15-mm endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal lad.  the stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  the lad, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm maverick balloon was advanced into the lad for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  at this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  a 3.5 x 18-mm endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  the asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  kissing inflations of the lad and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,results: , lesion reduction in the lad from 90% to 0% and timi 3 flow obtained.  lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less

female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  she has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  she has failed conservative therapy.  it was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  she elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  all risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  she was in agreement with the treatment plan.,procedure: , on 09/04/03, she was taken to operating room at abcd general hospital.  she was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the anesthesia department.  her leg was placed in a johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  a stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  intraoperative pictures were obtained.  the above findings were noted.  second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  an arthroscopic bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  a release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the bovie.  hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  next, the knee was suctioned dry.  an esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmhg.  an oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  the subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  the retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  the patellar tendon was identified.  the lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  the tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  it was then held in place with a steinmann pin.  following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  there was excellent fixation noted.  the q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  she was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  the medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  the retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 vicryl.  subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 vicryl.  skin was closed with #4-0 vicryl running pds suture.  sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  she was placed in a donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  it was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  she was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced

options and wishes to proceed.  he accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,operative procedure in detail: , the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position, prepped with betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  a 20- french foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  the table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  a midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  it was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  both obturator fossae were exposed.  standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  the left side was approached first by myself.  the limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to cooper's ligament distally.  meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  the right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  both packets were sent to pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,my attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  the  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  using gentle dissection with a kitner, i swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  a back bleeding control suture of 0 vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  a sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  the proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  when i was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,the urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  the prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  the lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  the seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  the bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  the prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  the bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  the bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  it was closed using a running 2-0 vicryl.  the mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 vicryl suture.  at the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  the field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  when i was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  a new 20-french foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  a safety suture of 0 prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  the table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the monocryl sutures were ligated.  the bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  the pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  a 10-french jackson-pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,the wound was then closed in layers.  the muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 vicryl subcuticular.  steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,the patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.  there were no complications.  sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.","surgery, mini-laparotomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, pelvic lymph, pelvic

 conformal simulation with coplanar beams.  this patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated. , Radiology, Conformal Simulation ,"conformal simulation with coplanar beams,this patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated.  it allows us to highly focus the beam of radiation and shape the beam to the target volume, delivering a homogenous dosage through it while sparing the surrounding, more radiosensitive, normal tissues.  this will allow us to give the optimum chance of tumor control while minimizing the acute and long-term side effects.,a conformal simulation is a simulation which involves extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist time and effort.  the patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room, where appropriate markers are placed, and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  one then approximates the field sizes and arrangements (gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields).  radiographs are taken, and these fields are marked on the patient's skin.  the patient is then transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat ct scan table.  scans are then performed through the targeted area.  the ct scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist, and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on each slice of the ct scan.  the dosimetrist then evaluates each individual slice in the treatment planning computer with the appropriately marked structures.  this volume is then reconstructed in 3-dimensional space.  utilizing the beam's-eye view features, the appropriate blocks are designed.  multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide homogenous coverage of the target volume while minimizing the dose to normal structures.  once all appropriate beam parameters and isodate distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, each individual slice is then reviewed by the physician.  the beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  once these are approved, cerrobend blocks will be custom fabricated.,if significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where the computer-designed fields are re-simulated.","radiology, coplanar beams, ct scan, target volume, conformal simulation, beamsNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

diagnoses:,  empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung.,postoperative diagnoses:,  empyema of the left chest, consolidation of the left lung, lung abscesses of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe.,operative procedure: , left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses, and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung.,anesthesia:,  general.,findings: , the patient has a complex history, which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two cat scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax.  there was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  the patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  a chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  then an abdominal ct scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal ct.  the patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  the patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  this was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,the patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  these were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  the chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  a second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  there were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  there was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  the adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  there seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  many cultures were taken from several areas.  the most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,the apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,procedure and technique:,  with the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  the chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  therefore, the next incision for thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  suture ligatures of prolene were required.  when the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with prolene sutures.,also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-french foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the foley catheter was removed.  the patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  a similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, gelfoam and surgicel.  after reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  as mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  then two #24 blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  one was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  these were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,good hemostasis was observed.  sponge count was reported as being correct.  intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 vicryl.  the chest wall was closed with running #1 vicryl and then 2-0 vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  the chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  sterile dressings were applied.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.","ent - otolaryngology, empyema, biopsies, bronchus, declaudication, endothoracic, hydropneumothorax, left lower lobe, left lung, left upper lobe, mainstem, pleura,

" newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.", Hematology - Oncology, Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Consult ,"chief complaint: , newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, right iliac vein and inferior vena cava (ivc), status post balloon angioplasty, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.,history of present illness: , the patient was transferred here the evening of 02/23/2007 from hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon.  history related to this illness probably dates back to october of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual ""lump"" posteriorly.  the left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  in early november, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  in december, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  he used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  he has lost 10 pounds since december and feels his appetite has decreased.  night sweats and cough began in december, for which he was treated with a course of augmentin.  however, both of these problems have continued.  he also began taking accutane for persistent acne in december (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at university of denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).,the morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  he was seen in emergency room where it was noted that he had an elevated wbc of 18,000.  ct scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that ct, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  he promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (dvt).  continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a pet/ct scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  this study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  because the wbc continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, sheryl asplund, m.d., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  these studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-b acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  the patient was transferred here after stopping of the continuous

posterior annuloplasty using a cosgrove galloway medtronic fuser band.,3.  posterior leaflet abscess resection.,anesthesia:  ,general endotracheal anesthesia,times:  ,aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,procedure in detail: , after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  a #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using bovie electrocautery.  the sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  next, the chest retractor was positioned.  the pericardium was opened with bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  we then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  a 2-0 ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  through this was passed our sec cannula.  this was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a y-shaped circuit.  next, a 3-0 prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  this was likewise connected to the y connection of our venous cannula portion.  we then used a 4-0 u-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the svc and ivc, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  sondergaard's groove was taken down.  next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  this was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  the left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  of note was the fact that the mitral valve p2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  the borders of the p2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  after doing so, the p2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 ethibond pledgeted suture.  this was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  the pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  next, the more anterior portion of the p2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  this was done without difficulty.  the apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  there was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  it was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  next, 2-0 non-pledgeted ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the cosgrove-galloway suture band ring from medtronic.  after, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the cg suture band.  the suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  we then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  we subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  we closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 prolene in a running fashion.  this was done without difficulty.  we de-aired the heart.  we then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  the aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  we then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 prolene.  we placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  the patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  we then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  this site was buttressed with a 4-0 prolene on an sh needle.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  we placed a mediastinal #32-french chest tube as well as a right chest blake drain.  the mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  there were none.  we closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the fascia was closed with a #1 vicryl followed by a 2-0 vicryl, followed by 3-0 vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition.","surgery,

 left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.  she came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull. , Surgery, Hemicraniectomy ,"title of operation:,  left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.,indication for surgery: ,  the patient is a patient well known to my service.  she came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  i took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  i spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor gcs of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  i discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  we went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  the patient was put in the intensive care unit.  we had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  we obtained a ct scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  at this point, once again i discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,procedure in detail: , the patient was taken to the operating room.  she was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  the head was put in a 3-pin mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin mayfield headholder.  the patient tolerated this well.  we sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a t-shaped incision with t vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  we connected this.  prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  we opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  we brought in the muscle with it.  we had a very good exposure of the skull.  we identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  we had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  at this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  all this was irrigated thoroughly.  once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  we had absolutely good hemostasis.  we put a piece of gelfoam over the brain.  we had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  i went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of duragen as well as a piece of gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  this running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although i put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  we cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  the ebl was about 200 cubic centimeters.  her hematocrit went down to about 21 and i ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood

an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  he is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  he was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  he has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,operative technique: , the patient was taken to or #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the department of anesthesia.  he was subsequently placed prone on the jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  his lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  a previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of l3 to s1.  this was in the midline.  skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  the lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of l3-s1.  once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of l3-l4.  once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  with palpation of the spinous processes, the l4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  these were readily mobile with digital palpation.  a rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of l3 to the superior half of s1.  this bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  the rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of l3 to superior half of s1.  once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of l4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of l3 to the superior half of s1.  the microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  there was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the l4 and l5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at l4-l5.  once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  the wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at l4-l5.  this was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  these were placed in the pedicles of l4 and l5 under direct intensification.  the position of the screws were visualized, both ap and lateral images.  they were deemed satisfactory.,once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across l4-l5.  this allowed for additional decompression of the l5 and l4 nerve roots.  once this was completed, the l5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the l4-l5 interval.  this was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  this was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of l4 and l5 bilaterally.  once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  a 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and allograft.  there were impacted at the interspace of l4-l5 under direct image intensification.  once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  the provisional screws and plates were removed.  this allowed for additional compression along l4-l5 with the cage instrumentation.  permanent screws were then placed at l4, l5, and s1 bilaterally.  this was performed under direct image intensification.  the position was verified in both ap and lateral images.  once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an am2 midas rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  the wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  the morcellized allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of l4-s1 bilaterally.  a 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from l4-s1.  appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  they were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the l4 vertebra.  once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  all connections were tightened and retightened in torque 2 specifications.  the wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  the dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  at the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the ssep, emg, and neurophysiologic monitors.  an 8-inch hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  the lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  the remainder of the hemovac was assembled.  bulky compression dressing utilizing adaptic, 4x4, and abds was then affixed to the lumbar spine with microfoam tape.  he was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.",

deficient inferior margin.  at completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,procedure: , after the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  a median sternotomy incision was performed.  dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  a subtotal thymectomy was performed.  systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  a small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  atrial appendage.  the aorta was then cannulated with an 8-french aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-french polystan right-angle cannula.  with an act greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  during cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  after 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-french catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-french polystan venous cannula.  the heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  it was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  the two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 pds suture.  following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  a right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  the atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 prolene suture.  the usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 prolene sutures.  the venous cannula was reinserted.  cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  the patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-french blake drains.  venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  all cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  with good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  the patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,i was the

Evaluation - 3 ,"reason for referral:,  the patient is a 76-year-old caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  he was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,relevant background information: , historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,history of presenting problem: , the patient was brought to the hospital emergency department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  he has no recollection of the event.  the following information is obtained from his medical record.  on 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""i do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  he does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  she thought he was warm and had chills.  he later returned to his baseline.  he was seen by dr. x in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  his neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the mini-mental status examination.  due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  the patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  he was hospitalized at hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative eeg, mri showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  he was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,in 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an mri at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,during this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  he thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  when i asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time.""  he appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  so, the patient reported some age related ""memory lapses"" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  however, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  he denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  he does not have to recheck information for errors.  he is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  he reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  he said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  he reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  he did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  he remains completely independent in his adls.  he denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  he is also able to handle their finances.  he did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,past medical history:,  includes coronary artery disease, status post cabg in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by dr. y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  note that due to back pain, he had been taking percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.,current medications: , celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,other medical history: , surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  the patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  he quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  he denied any illicit drug use.  please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  he also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived eeg was recommended.,mri completed on 09/30/09 showed ""mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated june 15, 2007.  no evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  ct scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  eeg was negative.  deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,family medical history:, reportedly significant for tias in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  in addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  he has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.,social history:,  the patient obtained a law degree from the university of baltimore.  he did not complete his undergraduate degree from the university of maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  he reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the bar.  he thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  he reported that he repeated math classes ""every year of school"" and attended summer school every year due to that.  he has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  he served also in the u.s.  coast guard between 1951 and 1953.  he has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, linda, who is a

,resection of left chest wall tumor, partial resection of left diaphragm, left lower lobe lung wedge resection, left chest wall reconstruction with gore-tex mesh.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal.,specimen:,  left chest wall with tumor and left lower lobe lung wedge resection to pathology.,indications for procedure:,  the patient is a 79-year-old male who began to experience back pain approximately 2 years ago, which increased.  chest x-ray and ct scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening.  a biopsy was performed at an outside hospital (kaiser) and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma.  the patient had a metastatic workup, which was negative including a brain mri and bone scan.  the bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor.  the patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease, hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, longstanding atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  he and his family were apprised of the high-risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,procedure in detail: , the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  the patient was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  intravenous antibiotics were given.  a foley catheter was placed.  the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  an incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass.  the skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery.  good hemostasis was obtained.  the tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib.  a thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space.  inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions, which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  the thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly.  it was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor, approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected.  the ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect.  the ribs 7, 8, 9, and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery.  hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips.  the chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly.  it was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement.  inferiorly, the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor.  the spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected.  inferiorly, the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace.  the dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine.  the left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the gia 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe, which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung.  a 2-0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection.  posteriorly, the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately t8 and t9, where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies.  the ribs were disarticulated, closed to or at their articulations with the spine.  bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery.  there was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta.,the posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section.  the specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room.  hemostasis was obtained.  the vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure-of-8 #1 ethibond sutures.  this produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension.  a single 32-french chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly.  this was secured with a #1 silk suture.  the gore-tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect.  a series of #1 prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually.  the resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate.  the serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure-of-8 0 vicryl.  the latissimus was reapproximated with a two #1 vicryl placed in running fashion.  of note, two #10 jp drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3-0 vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4-0 monocryl.  the wounds were dressed.  the patient was brought from the operating room directly to the north icu, intubated in stable condition.  all counts were correct.,","surgery, chest wall tumor resection, diaphragm, left lower lobe, lung wedge resection, chest wall reconstruction,

 markedly elevated pt inr despite stopping coumadin and administering vitamin k. patient with a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis. , Hematology - Oncology, Hematology Consult - 1 ,"history of present illness:,  the patient is well known to me for a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis.  we corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (iv) iron.  ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  this is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (dvt) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,chart was reviewed, and i will not reiterate her complex history.,i am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,she had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,she is on total parenteral nutrition (tpn) as well.,laboratory data:,  labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  mcv is 89.  her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  white blood count has improved.,pt has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an inr of 5.0.  this is despite stopping coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin k via the tpn, as well as additional doses iv.  the pt is slightly improved over the last few days, being high at 65.0 with an inr of 7.3 yesterday.,ptt has not been checked since 05/18/2007 and was normal then at 28.,lfts have been elevated.  alt is 100, ast 57, ggt 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, ldh normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  other electrolytes are fairly normal.,b12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  folic acid was normal.  iron saturation has not been checked since march, and was normal then.  ferritin has not been checked in a couple of months.,current medications: , erythropoietin 45,000 units every week, started 05/16/2007.  she is on heparin flushes, loperamide, niacin,

frustrated with her prolonged hospital stay.  she notes that she had epistaxis a few days ago, requiring nasal packing and fortunately that had resolved now.,vital signs:  today, temperature is 98.5, pulse 99, respirations 16, blood pressure 105/65, and pulse is 95.  she is not requiring oxygen.,skin:  no significant ecchymoses are noted.,abdomen:  ileostomy is in place, with greenish black liquid output.  midline surgical scar has healed well, with a dressing in place in the middle, with no bleeding noted.,extremities:  she has no peripheral edema.,cardiac:  regular rate.,lymphatics:  no adenopathy is noted.,lungs:  clear bilaterally.,impression and plan:,  markedly elevated pt/inr despite stopping coumadin and administering vitamin k.  i will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated lfts, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.,it is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated ptt and not pt.  i will check a ptt and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  it is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  i agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.,she has markedly elevated platelet count.  i suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.,anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  given her decreased creatinine clearance, i agree with erythropoietin support.  she was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  she has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  if she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  i will check a ferritin.  this may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  if it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  if it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.,she needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.,i will discuss the case with dr. x as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.  she is not a surgical candidate now with her elevated pt/inr.",

reciprocating saw, intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made.  following this, the cutting block for high-flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional posterior condyle.  using a reciprocating saw, the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed.  the bone with its attached soft tissue was removed.  once the femoral preparation was completed, attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia.  the medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were well protected with a retractor.  the pcl retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated anteriorly.  osteophytes were removed.  the extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amount of external rotation was considered reference to the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  similarly, horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the distal 1/3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe.  once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane, the tibial em guide was well secured and then posterior slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest.  a built-in 7-degree posterior slope was considered with instrumentation.  now, the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially, which was the most affected site.  tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mechanical axis in the coronal plane.  the resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site.  the resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially.  now, attention was placed for the removal of the posterior osteophytes from the femoral condyle.  using curved osteotome, angle curette, and a rongeur, the posterior osteophytes were removed.  now, attention was placed for confirming the flexion-extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion.  rectangular gap was achieved with appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension.  the 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory with good stability in flexion and extension.,attention was now placed for completion of the tibia.  size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned.  appropriate external rotation was maintained with the help of the horseshoe alignment rod.  reference to the tibial crest distally and 2nd toe was considered as before.  the midpoint of the trial tray was collinear with the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  the rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed with intramedullary drill followed by broach impactor.  at this point, trial femoral and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner.  the range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory.  no further soft tissue release was indicated.  i was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee.,attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella.  using a patellar caliper, the thickness was measured to be 21.5 mm.  this gives an ideal resection of 8.5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact.  reaming was initiated with a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm with the reaming alignment guide.  using a caliper, the resected patella was measured, which was noted to be 13 mm.  a 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well.  drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted without any difficulty.  the tracking was satisfactory.  there was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella.  the trial components position was satisfactory.  the alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory.  all the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with pulsavac lavage irrigation mechanical system.  the resected surfaces were dried with a sponge.  two batches of palacos cement were mixed.  the cementing was initiated starting with tibia followed by femur and patella.  excess peripheral cement were removed with the curette and knife.  the knee was positioned in extension with a 12 mm trial liner.  patellar clamp was placed after cementing the all-poly patella.  once the cement was set hard and cured, tourniquet was deflated.  hemostasis was achieved.  the trial 12 mm liner was replaced with definitive prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene liner.  range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees.  anterior-posterior drawer test was satisfactory.  medial and lateral stability was satisfactory.  patellar tracking was satisfactory.  the wound was thoroughly irrigated.  hemostasis was achieved.  a local cocktail was injected, which included the mixture of 0.25% plain marcaine, 30 mg of toradol, and 4 mg of morphine.  the quadriceps mechanism and distal arthrotomy was repaired with #1 vicryl in figure-of-8 fashion.  the subcutaneous closure was performed in layers using 2-0 vicryl and 0 vicryl followed by 2-0 vicryl proximally.  the skin was approximated with staples.  sterile dressings were placed including xeroform, 4x4, abd, and bias.  the patient was then transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  there were no intraoperative complications noted.  she tolerated the procedure very well.",

as well as a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the osteomed screw fixation system.,description of the procedure:,  the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  after adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  the left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmhg.  the left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  the left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe.  the incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  all the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  the incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  all the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal.  the conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion.  a lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  the dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  the same saw was used to perform an austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  the dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  the capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction.  the same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 osteomed system upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using ao technique.  the wires were removed.  fixation on the table was found to be excellent.  reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical.  the remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw.  the area was copiously flushed with saline.  the periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 vicryl suture material, 4-0 vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  the incision site was reinforced with steri-strips.  at this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  the time was 45 minutes.  immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  the patient's incision was covered with xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and kling, stockinette, and an ace bandage.  the patient's left foot was then placed in a surgical shoe.  the patient was then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  the patient was given pain medication and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  the patient was discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with dr. x in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","orthopedic, internal screw

for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  i have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was i primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as i did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of cva, although we cannot really make that null.  the patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  i invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,procedure note:  ,the

participate in this time-out procedure.  after the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  there was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead ekg.,impression: , cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 3.22.  we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  i had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, dr. x, at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and i will be planning to place a call for dr. x myself.  again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and i suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,i had previously discussed the case with dr. y who is the

with a dual-lumen tube.,operative procedure in detail: , after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  in addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  after applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery.  the abdomen was opened.  next, a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  in an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  next, we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver.  this was done and the stomach was freed up.  we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  at this point the stomach was freely mobile.  we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  a 2-0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz.  we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  we placed a 16-french red rubber catheter through this site.  we tied down in place.  we then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a witzel.  next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  this was done with #1 prolene.  we put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl.,next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  we then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery.  next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  the lung was deflated.  we placed standard chest retractors.  next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  the azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  as mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  after doing this, we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  we used an automatic pursestring and applied.  we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors.  we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 gia stapler.  after doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery.  we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  we connected our anvil to the eea stapler.  this was then secured appropriately.  we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  we then fired the stapler.  we obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  this was closed with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  we then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 vicryl interrupted sutures.  we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  next, we placed two #28-french chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  we then closed the chest with #2 vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the lung was brought up.  we closed the muscle layers with #0 vicryl followed by #0 vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 vicryl and the skin with 4-0 monocryl.  sterile dressing was applied.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition.","surgery, ivor-lewis, esophagogastrectomy, jejunostomy, thoracotomy, dual-lumen tube, chest tubes, bovie electrocautery, chest,

all of which have provided inadequate relief.  at this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  the risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by dr. x and the consent is available on the chart for review.,procedure in detail: , after iv was established by the department of anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  copious amounts of webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the webril.,after adequate iv sedation was administered by the department of anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard mayo block fashion.  the foot was elevated off the table.  esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmhg.  the foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  a sterile betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  a #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  all superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  the capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  a hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  the medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  next, a 0.45 inch kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  a sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,the capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  the bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  next, a 0.45 inch kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  a 2.7 x 18 mm synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard ao technique.  excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  a second 2.0 x 80 mm synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard ao technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  the temporary fixation was removed.  a medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  the foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,a sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  a distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal akin osteotomy was done.,after the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  a #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  a #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  the monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  the foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  next, a #3-0 vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  next, #4-0 vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  the steri-strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of owen silk, 4 x 4s, kling, kerlix, and coban.  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  the patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  she was transported via cart to the postanesthesia care unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  she is to be partial weightbearing

seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, dr. xyz will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  i explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  she understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  we have asked for stat protime today.  she is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  she is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  dr. xyz advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra percocet if needed.  i will plan on evaluating her in the clinic on tuesday.  i have also asked that she stop her paxil, and we plan on starting her on cymbalta instead.  she voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  i have also asked her to get an

and as i worked to the right of the midline, i encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces.  the c5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until i was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen.  the root had a somewhat high takeoff but i worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it.  again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.  central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression.  this was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm cloward punches.,attention was then turned to the c5-c6 space.  here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord.  i slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord.  this necessitated undercutting the bodies of both c5 and c6 extensively, but i was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord.  i exposed the c6 root and widely decompressed it until i was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right.  the microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved.,attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  a high-speed cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of c5-c6, c4-c5 and c3-c4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration.  bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use.,attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  using the various synthes sizers, i selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at c5-c6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at c4-c5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at c3-c4.  each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge.  i decided to use bmp in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks.  the bmp sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft.,under distraction, the graft was placed at c3-c4, c4-c5, and c5-c6 as described.  an x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis.,attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation.  various sizes of synthes plates were selected until i decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate.  the plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush.  the holes were drilled and the screws were placed.  eight screws were placed with two screws at c3, two screws at c4, two screws at c5, and two screws at c6.  all eight screws had good purchase.  the locking screws were tightly applied.  an x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws.,attention was turned to closure.  the wound was copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  a medium hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin.  the wound was then carefully closed in layers.  sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,the patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  the sponge and needle counts were reported as correct.  there were no intraoperative complications.,specimens were sent to pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue.",

could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  curettings were negative for malignancy.  the patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  the ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  there was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  no other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  the upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  the appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  the ileum was within normal limits with no meckel's diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  there was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,operative procedure:  the patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  a midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  with a #10 bard parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  the fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 bard parker blade after incision was made with mayo scissors.  a balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  this giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  the infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 vicryl suture.  the right round ligament was ligated with #0 vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  the infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  an attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  after this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  the bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 vicryl suture.  after removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with mayo scissors, and the straight ochsner was placed by #0 vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  the cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 bard parker blade knife and a curved ochsner was placed by #0 vicryl suture.  the cervix was again grasped with a lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 bard parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  a single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  the vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  the round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 vicryl suture.  the ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  the pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  the appendix was grasped with babcock forceps.  the mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with metzenbaum scissors.  the curved hemostats were placed with #00 vicryl suture.  the base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 bard parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 vicryl.  no bleeding was noted.  sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  all packs and retractors were removed.  the peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 pds, but prior to closure, a marshall-marchetti-krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 vicryl suture.  following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an allis forceps at the level of the bartholin glands.  an incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with metzenbaum scissors.  the flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  in this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 vicryl suture.  excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 vicryl suture.  the bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 vicryl suture.  the skin was

soft tissue damage.  oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  after review of the ct and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,description of procedure:, the patient was brought to the operating room #2 at hospital.  he was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  asa monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with iv anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,the patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  the surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  approximately 10 ml of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  this was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  the patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  he has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  this was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  approximately 5 ml of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,after waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  the periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  the fracture was noted and it was displaced.  manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  this was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  the wound was then packed with moist ray-tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  approximately 5 ml of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  after waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  it was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  the fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  the fracture was noted to be well reduced.  the wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  the patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  he was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  attention was then directed extraorally.  this was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 vicryl, 4-0 vicryl, and 5-0 prolene on skin.  attention was then again directed into the mouth.  the throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  the patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  at this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,the patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the pacu in excellent condition.","surgery, mandible, endotracheal, leibinger, pacu, oral

however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  based on this, i did total decompression by removing the lamina of c3 through c6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at c3-c4, c4-c5, c5-c6, and c6-c7 with no spinal instrumentation.  operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  there is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  this may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  there is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of csf leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  this too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  the patient understood the risk of the surgery.  i told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,description of procedure: , the patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  after smooth induction and intubation, a foley catheter was inserted.  monitoring leads were also placed by premier neurodiagnostics for both ssep and emg monitoring.  the sseps were normal, and the emgs were silent during the entire case.  after completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  all pressure points were padded.  i proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  this was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with duraprep.,after sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of c2 was then identified.  there was absence of the spinous process of c3, c4, c5, and c6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  with this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at c3, c4, c5, and c6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  there was also a dural tear on the right c3-c4 space that was exposed and repaired with prolene 6-0 and later with tisseel.  by careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at c3-c4, c4-c5, c5-c6, and c6-c7.  there was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  at two points, i had to pack this with small pieces of gelfoam.  after repair of the dural tear, valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any csf leakage.  area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with tisseel.  the wound was then closed in layers with vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia;

chronic sinusitis as well as nasal polyposis that have been refractory to outpatient medical management.  she has underwent sinus surgery in the past approximately 12 years ago with the ct evaluation revealed evidence of chronic mucosal thickening within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses as well as the presence of polyposis within the nasal cavities bilaterally.,procedure:  ,after all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  the patient was brought to the operative suite where she was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered by the department of anesthesia.  the patient was rotated 90 degrees away where cotton pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavity.  the nasal septum, as well as the turbinates were then localized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,attention was directed first to the left nasal cavity.  a zero-degree sinus endoscope was inserted into the nasal cavity down to the level of the nasopharynx.  the initial examination revealed a gross polypoid disease emanating from the sphenoid sinuses as well as off the supreme turbinate.  there was also polypoid disease present within the left middle meatus.  nasopharynx was visualized with a patent eustachian tube.  at this point, the xps micro debrider was used to take down all the polyps emanating from the inferior surface of the left middle turbinate as well as from the supreme turbinate.  the ostium to the sphenoid sinus was visualized and was not entered.  at this point, the left middle turbinate was localized and then medialized with the use of a freer elevator.  a ball-tip probe was then used to localize the openings for the natural maxillary ostium.  side-biting forceps were used to take down the uncinate process and was further taken down with the use of the microdebrider.  the opening of the maxillary sinus was visualized.  the posterior fontanelle was taken down with the use of straight line forceps.  it should be mentioned that tissue was very thick and polypoid with chronic inflammatory changes evident.  the maxillary sinus ostia was then suctioned with olive-tip suction and maxillary wash was performed.  the remainder of the anterior ethmoid was then cleaned again removing excess polypoid tissue.  the basal lamella was visualized and the posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered with use of the microdebrider as the surgical assistant palpated the patient's eyes for any vibration.  all polypoid tissue was collected in the microdebrider and sent as a surgical specimen.  once all polypoid tissue has been removed, the cocaine pledgets were reinserted into the ethmoid air cells for hemostatic purposes.  attention was then directed to the right nasal cavity.  again, a sinus endoscope was inserted.  inspection revealed a grossly hypertrophied turbinate.  it was felt that this enlarged and polypoid turbinate was contributing the patient's symptoms.  therefore, the turbinate was localized and a hemostat was used to crush the mid portion of the turbinate, which was then resected with use of side-biting scissors as well the takahashi forceps.  sinus endoscope was then inserted all the way down through the nasopharynx.  again, the eustachian tube was visualized without any obstructing lesions or masses.  upon retraction, there was again polypoid tissue noted within the ethmoid sinuses.  the ball-tip probe was again used to locate the right maxillary ostium.  the side-biting forceps was used further take down the uncinate process.  the maxillary ostium was then widened with use of a xps microdebrider.  a maxillary sinus wash was then performed.  now, the attention was directed to the ethmoid air cells.  it should be mentioned again that the tissue of the anterior ethmoid was very thickened and polypoid.  this was again taken down with the use of xps microdebrider while the surgical assistant carefully palpated the patient's eye.,once all polypoid tissue have been removed, some bleeding that was encountered was controlled with the use of suction cautery in a very conservative manner.  once all bleeding has been controlled, all surgical instruments were removed and merocel packing was placed in the bilateral nasal cavities with the intent to remove in the recovery room.  at this point, the procedure was felt to be complete.  the patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room without incident.","surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, nasal polypectomy, turbinate reduction, sinus surgery, sinus endoscope, maxillary sinus, nasal

were taken, the lead shield was removed.,prophylaxis was then performed using a prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  the patient's teeth were rinsed well.  the patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  clinical and radiographic examination followed and areas of decay were noted.  during the restorative phase, these areas of decay were incidentally removed.  entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  final caries removal was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm and sound dentin.,teeth restored with composite ___________  bonded with a one-step bonding agent.  teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.  the caries were extensive and invaded the pulp tissues, pulp therapy was initiated using viscostat and then irm pulpotomies.  teeth treated in such a manner would then be crowned with stainless steel crowns.,upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  the original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  the continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.  at the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, was taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,findings: , this young patient

 qualified medical evaluation report of a patient with back pain., IME-QME-Work Comp etc., Qualified Medical Evaluation Report ,"history of injury and present complaints: , the patient is a 59-year-old gentleman.  he is complaining chiefly of persistent lower back pain.  he states the pain is of a rather constant nature.  he describes it as a rather constant dull ache, sometimes rather sharp and stabbing in nature, most localized to the right side of his back more so than the left side of his lower back.  he states he has difficulty with prolonged standing or sitting.  he can only stand for about 5-10 minutes, then he has to sit down.  he can only sit for about 15-20 minutes, he has to get up and move about because it exacerbates his back pain.  he has difficulty with bending and stooping maneuvers.  he describes an intermittent radiating pain down his right leg, down from the right gluteal hip area to the back of the thigh to the calf and the foot.  he gets numbness along the lateral aspect of the foot itself.  he also describes chronic pain complaints with associated tension in the back of his neck.  he states the pain is of a constant nature in his neck.  he states he gets pain that radiates into the right shoulder girdle area and the right forearm.  he describes some numbness along the lateral aspect of the right forearm.  he states he has trouble trying to use his arm at or above shoulder height.  he has difficulty pushing, pulling, gripping, and grasping with the right upper extremity.  he describes pain at the anterior aspect of his shoulder, in particular.  he denies any headache complaints.  he is relating his above complaints to two industrial injuries that he sustained while employed with frito lay company as a truck driver or delivery person.  he relates an initial injury that occurred on 06/29/1994, when apparently he was stepping out of the cab of his truck.  he lost his footing and fell.  he reached out to grab the hand railing.  he fell backwards on his back and his right shoulder.  he had immediate onset of shoulder pain, neck pain, and low back pain.  he had pain into his right leg.  he initially came under the care of dr. h, an occupational physician in modesto.  initially, he did not obtain any mris or x-rays.  he did undergo some physical therapy and received some medications.  dr. h referred him to dr. q, a chiropractor for three visits, which the patient was not certain was very helpful.  the patient advises he then changed treating physicians to dr. n, d.c., whom he had seen previously for some back pain complaints back in 1990.  he felt that the chiropractic care was helping his back, neck, and shoulder pain complaints somewhat.  he continues with rather persistent pain in his right shoulder.  he underwent an mri of the right shoulder performed on 08/16/1994 which revealed prominent impingement with biceps tenosynovitis as well as supraspinatus tendonitis superimposed by a small pinhole tear of the rotator cuff.  the patient was referred to dr. p, an orthopedic surgeon who suggested some physical therapy for him and some antiinflammatories.  he felt that the patient might require a cortisone injection or possibly a surgical intervention.  the patient also underwent an mri of the cervical spine on 08/03/1994, which again revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease in his neck.  there is some suggestion of bilateral neuroforaminal encroachment due to degenerative changes and disc bulges, particularly at c5-6 and c6-7 levels.  the patient was also seen by dr. p, a neurologist for a neurology consult.  it is unclear to me as to whether or not dr. p had performed an emg or nerve conduction studies of his upper or lower extremities.  the patient was off work for approximately six months following his initial injury date that occurred on 06/29/1994.  he returned back to regular duty.  dr. n declared him permanent and stationary on 04/04/1995.  the patient then had a recurrence or flare-up or possibly new injury, again, particularly to his lower back while working for frito lay on 03/29/1997, when he was loading some pallets on the back of a trailer.  at that time, he returned to see dr. n for chiropractic care, who is his primary treating physician.  dr. n took him off work again.  he was off work again for approximately another six months, during which time, he was seen by dr. m, m.d., a neurosurgeon.  he had a new mri of his lumbar spine performed.  the mri was performed on 05/20/1997.  it revealed l4-5 disc space narrowing with prominent disc bulge with some mild spinal stenosis.  the radiologist had noted he had a prior disc herniation at this level with some improvement from prior exam.  dr. m saw him on 09/18/1997 and noted that there was some improvement in his disc herniation at the l4-5 level following a more recent mri exam of 05/20/1997, from previous mri exam of 1996 which revealed a rather prominent right-sided l4-5 disc herniation.  dr. m felt that there was no indication for a lumbar spine surgery, but he mentioned with regards to his cervical spine, he felt that emg studies of the right upper extremity should be obtained and he may require a repeat mri of the cervical spine, if the study was positive.  the patient did undergo some nerve conduction studies of his lower extremities with dr. k, m.d., which suggested a possible abnormal emg with evidence of possible l5 radiculopathy, both right and left.  unfortunately, i had no medical reports from dr. p suggesting that he may have performed nerve conduction studies or emgs of the upper and lower extremities.  the patient did see dr. r for a neurosurgical consult.  dr. r evaluated both his neck and lower back pain complaints on several occasions.  dr. r suggested that the patient try some cervical epidural steroid injections and lumbar selective nerve root blocks.  the patient underwent these injections with dr. k.  the patient reported only very slight relief temporarily with regards to his back and leg symptoms following the injections.  it is not clear from the medical record review whether the patient ever had a cervical epidural steroid injection; it appears that he had some selective nerve root blocks performed in the lumbar spine.  dr. r on 12/15/2004 suggested that the patient had an mri of the cervical spine revealing a right-sided c5-6 herniated nucleus pulposus which would explain his c-6 distribution numbness.  the patient also was noted to have a c4-5 with rather severe degenerative disc disease.  he felt the patient might be a candidate for a two-level acdf at c4-5 and c5-6.  dr. r in another report of 08/11/2004 suggested that the patient's mri of 05/25/2004 of the lumbar spine reveals multilevel degenerative disc disease.  he had an l4-5 slight anterior spondylolisthesis, this may be a transitional vertebrae at the l6 level as well, with lumbarization of s1.  he felt that his examination suggested a possible right s1 radiculopathy with discogenic back pain.  he would suggest right-sided s1 selective nerve root blocks to see if this would be helpful; if not, he might be a candidate for a lumbar spine fusion, possibly a dynesys or a fusion or some major spine surgery to help resolve his situation., ,the patient relates that he really prefers a more conservative approach of treatment regarding his neck, back, and right shoulder symptoms.  he continued to elect chiropractic care which he has found helpful, but apparently the insurance carrier is no longer authorizing chiropractic care for him.  he is currently taking no medications to manage his pain complaints.  he states regarding his work status, he was off work again for another six months following the 03/29/1997 injury.  he returned back to work and continued to work regular duty up until about a year ago, at which time, he was taken back off work again and placed on ttd status by dr. n, his primary treating physician.  the patient states he has not been back to work since.  he has since applied for social security disability and now is receiving social security disability benefits.  the patient states he has tried some myox therapy with dr. h on 10 sessions, which he found somewhat helpful.  overall, the patient does not feel that he could return back to his usual and customary work

with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on june 22, 2007.  the patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  after appropriate cross match and workup of hla typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,preoperative diagnosis:,  endstage renal disease.,postoperative diagnosis: , endstage renal disease.,procedure:,  cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,estimated blood loss: , 400 ml.,fluids:  ,one liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,anesthesia:  ,general endotracheal.,specimen:  ,none.,drain: , none.,complications: , none.,the patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  after adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the asis down to the suprapubic space.  after this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  camper's and scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  the external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  after these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  after the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  after the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  this was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  the round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  the dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  this alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  after the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  the right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  after the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  an additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  this was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  the dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  at this time, satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  this was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  the heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  the renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  a 5-0 double-ended prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 prolene, these were tied down and secured.  the renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  the dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  after such time the 5-0 prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  after this was done and the artery was secured, the satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  the flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  the bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  the kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  at this time, all satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  the dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  this was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  at this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  this was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  additional vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  at this time, an ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  this was inspected and noted for proper control.  irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  at this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  the kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  a 1-0 prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  this was secured and knots were dumped.  subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running monocryl.  the patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the dunn icu where he was noted to be stable.  dr. a was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.","nephrology, endstage renal disease, ethibond, satinsky clamp, aponeurosis, cadaveric, cross match, curvilinear incision, hemodialysis,

on the operative table in supine position.  after this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient was then placed upon a shoulder roll.  after this, the skin incision was marked approximately two fingerbreadths above the sternal notch.  it was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:1000 approximately 7 cc total.,after this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a #10 blade was then utilized to make a skin incision.  the subcutaneous tissue was then bluntly dissected utilizing a ray-tec sponge and a bear claw was then utilized to retract the upper incisional skin with counter retraction performed to allow a subplatysmal plane of skin flaps to be performed in superior and inferolateral directions.  after this, the midline was then identified and grasped on either side with a debakey forceps.  the raphe was noted and bovie cauterization was utilized to cut down into this region.  the fine stats were utilized to further open this area with exposure and bisection of the sternothyroid muscle.  it was separated on the left side from the patient's sternothyroid muscle.  after this, the sternothyroid muscle was identified, grasped with the debakey forceps and infiltrated initially through its fascial plane with the metzenbaum scissors.  blunt dissection was then utilized to free the sternothyroid muscle from the thyroid gland in superior and inferior directions and laterally with the help of kitners.  after this, the plane was rotated more anteriorly with the superior and inferior parathyroid glands identified.  the fat cap was noted to be attached on the superior parathyroid to the posterior aspect of the thyroid itself.  it was freed from the thyroid gland and reflected laterally and posteriorly.  the inferior parathyroid gland actually appeared to be attached also to the inferior aspect of the thyroid itself and was reflected laterally.  after this, the patient's thyroid gland was palpated noting a thyroid nodule in the posterior inferior aspect along with the calcification laterally.  the nodule appeared to be sort of rubbery in consistency and approximately 1 cm diameter.  as the gland was rotated more anteriorly, the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side was identified and further dissection along berry's ligament on the medial aspect was performed.  the middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid artery were both cauterized with a bipolar cautery and bisected.  after this, the gland was easily rotated anteriorly with further dissection carried up to the superior pole.  the superior pole was exposed with the help of a richardson and army-navy retractors with cross-clamping and tying of the superior laryngeal artery and vein.  further, the small bleeding vessels were identified and bipolared, and cut with the metzenbaum scissors.  the superior pole was finally freed and the gland was rotated more anteriorly onto the anterior aspect of the trachea.  berry's ligament was finally freed and the gland was cross-clamped on the opposing thyroid isthmus with a mosquito.  after this, the gland was cut with a metzenbaum scissors and tied with a #3-0 undyed vicryl tie.  the defect on the neck now was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  surgicel was then cut in small strips and three replaced in the lateral part of the neck.,the opposing side of the thyroid gland on the right was palpated with no noticeable nodules or masses.  the strap muscles were then reapproximated with #3-0 vicryl on a sh, followed by reapproximation of the subcutaneous tissue with #4-0 vicryl, followed by reapproximation of the skin by running subcuticular #5-0 prolene and a #6-0 fast absorbing gut.  mastisol, steri-strips, and bacitracin were placed followed by a sterile 4 x 4 dressing.  the patient was then turned back to anesthesia, extubated in the operating room, and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and will be admitted to hospital for 23-hour observation and will be followed up in one week afterwards.","endocrinology, thyroid lumpectomy, thyroid uptake scan, thyroid mass nodule, total thyroid lumpectomy, parathyroid glands, berry's ligament, metzenbaum scissors,

 squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.  right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3., Neurology, Skull Base Reconstruction ,"preoperative diagnosis:,  squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,postoperative diagnosis: , squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,procedure: , right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal.,description of procedure:  ,the patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position.  general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  the neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  the neck was prepped as well.  after this was performed, i made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  a wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  after this was performed, i used the bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  the condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  the neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  the neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  the external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  a large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  i then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  it became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore i did use the router, i mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  the internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and i drilled carotid canal up until it made.  i dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  once this was dissected out, dr. x entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  for details, please see his operative note.,after dr. x had completed the resection, i then harvested the rectus free flap.  a skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  the skin paddle was incised with the bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  the sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  the skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 vicryl.  the anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  the vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  the muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large hemoclips on each vessel.  the wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  the rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  the inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 ethilon as well.  there was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  the wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  the eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  the muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  i removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  the wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with skin staples.  there was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  the skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,the abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  the subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  the patient was then turned over to the neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  the patient was then transferred to the pacu in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.","neurology, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath,

", Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Complex Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease ,"history:,  the patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  he had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified blalock-taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  these procedures were performed at medical college hospital.  family states that they moved to the united states.  evaluation at the children's hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  he was also found to have elevated glenn pressures at 22 mmhg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmhg.  the qp:qs ratio of 0.6:1.  a large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  the patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,description of procedure: , after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,using a 6-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,using a 6-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  a separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-french sheath.,percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  using percutaneous technique and a 5-french sheath, 5-french wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  this catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  the catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-french bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  a balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  there was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right glenn.  the jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-french flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  the bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a terumo guidewire.  probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  the angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  the distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  the length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin sd 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  this facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  a pg 2960 bpx genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm optiprobe.  a balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin sds 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  the balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the optiprobe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  the proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a pg 2980 bpx genesis stent premounted on 8-mm optiprobe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a pg 1870 bpx genesis stent premounted on 7-mm optiprobe balloon catheter.  repeat angiograms were then performed.  attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  a selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  an amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  the 4-french bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  a pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications.,discussion:,  oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  the pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmhg in 30% oxygen.  remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  there was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an a-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  mean glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmhg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmhg.  the calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a qp:qs ratio of 0.6:1.  the pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 woods units.  following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the glenn venous pressures to 16 mmhg.  following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  there was similar increase in glenn pressures to 28 mmhg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmhg.  there was an increase in

08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral t-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  followup ekg done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs.,impression:  ,she is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and i suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  there has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  i do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  she actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, i feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  continued optimization of electrolytes.  the patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  the patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  i do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with dr. x after discharge.  regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, i would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, hypokalemia, shortness of breath, atrial tachycardia, sinus rhythm, hip fracture, atrial, tachycardia, rhythm, apcs, cardiac,

" request for consultation to evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.", Consult - History and Phy., Request For Consultation ,"reason for consultation:, please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,history of present illness:, the patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  the patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  about the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  she has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  she also took an nsaid about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  about two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  she does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  she was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  she notes no other problems with her skin.  she remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  she has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,physical examination:, reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  the posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but i saw no erosions on the areas today.  there did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  there were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,impression: , erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. the patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. she has had no diarrhea today, however. she has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,i am not as familiar with the nsaid causing an erosive stomatitis.  i understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, i would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,recommended therapy: ,i agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  i also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. however, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  topically i have prescribed lidex gel, which i find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  it can be applied t.i.d.  ,thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  i will follow her with you as needed.","consult - history and phy., stomatitis, nsaid, blistering, blisters, buccal mucosa, dermatitis, erosive stomatitis, gastrointestinal, methotrexate, mouth, rheumatoid arthritis, stomatitis conditions, superficial erosions, upper respiratory infection, illness, medication"
